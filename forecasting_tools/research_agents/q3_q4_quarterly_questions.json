        "background_info": "[Figure skating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating) is a winter sport in which individuals, pairs, or groups perform on ice while incorporating jumps, spins, lifts, and footwork into choreographed routines set to music. The [World Figure Skating Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_World_Figure_Skating_Championships), organised annually by the [International Skating Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Skating_Union) (ISU) since 1896, represents the most prestigious annual competition in the sport outside the Olympic Games. The [2025 World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_World_Figure_Skating_Championships) are scheduled to take place in Boston, from March 25 to March 30.\n\nIn all official competitions, athletes are scored using the [ISU Judging System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISU_Judging_System), which consists of two components: the Technical Score (TES) and the Program Components Score (PCS). The Technical Score assesses the difficulty and execution of specific elements (jumps, spins, and step sequences) with each element receiving a base value [ranging](https://www.usfigureskating.org/sites/default/files/media-files/ISU%202656%20ISU_SOV_SinglesPairs_2024-25_final.pdf) from 0.40 to 14, which is then adjusted using a -5 to +5 grade based on the athlete's execution. The Program Components Score evaluates five aspects of the performance: skating skills, transitions, performance, composition, and interpretation of music, with judges awarding points on a scale of 0.25 to 10.00 in each category.\n\nThe TES and PCS are added together to form the Total Segment Score (TSS), which is calculated for both short programs and free skating and added together to determine an athlete's final ranking.",

The discussion was meant to seal a deal granting the US access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals in exchange for continued support against Russia. Instead, Trump criticised Zelenskyy for lacking gratitude for US aid and questioned his approach to the war, while Zelenskyy insisted on security guarantees from the US and emphasised Russia's role as the aggressor in the war.\n\nThe unresolved meeting left US support for Ukraine uncertain, with Zelenskyy not signing the deal before departing from the White House. Various European leaders voiced support for Ukraine, Keir Starmer [insisted](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-leaders-pledge-increase-defense-spending-nato-mark-rutte-keir-starmer-london-summit/) that any peace plan must have US' backing. A few days after leaving the Oval Office, [Zelenskyy said](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8j0ggm3mdwo) that he would still be willing to sign a deal on rare earth minerals.\n\nDuring his 2024 campaign, Trump [promised](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/us/politics/trump-promise-ending-ukraine-war.html) to end the Russia-Ukraine war early in his presidency, often suggesting he could broker peace through direct talks with Moscow, a stance he framed as pragmatic and cost-saving for the US.",

Both forecast every two days, using the same basic prompt (example for binary questions):\n\n> You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.Your interview question is:\n> \\{title}\n> \u200e\n> Question background:\n> \\{background}\n> \u200e\n> This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\n> \\{resolution\\_criteria}\n> \\{fine\\_print}\n> \u200e\n> Your research assistant says:\n> \\{summary\\_report}\n> \u200e\n> Today is\n> \\{today}.\n> \u200e\n> Before answering you write:\n> (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n> (b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n> (c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n> (d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n> \u200e\n> You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n> \u200e\n> The last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\nwith the prompt for AskNews being\n\n> You are an assistant to a superforecaster. The superforecaster will give you a question they intend to forecast on. To be a great assistant, you generate a concise but detailed rundown of the most relevant news, including if the question would resolve Yes or No based on current information. You do not produce forecasts yourself.\n> \u00a0\n> Note that bots do not affect forecaster ranks or scores in any way.",

The proposed withdrawal could occur within 30, 60, or 90 days, though officials emphasise that no final decision has been made.

The US military mission in Syria has been to counter ISIS and support local military groups, such as the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

All severe cases were reported to be severely malnourished. Among the cases, 31 deaths have been registered. The majority of cases reported are among children, particularly those under five years of age. The area is rural and remote, with access further hindered by the ongoing rainy season. Reaching it from Kinshasa by road takes an estimated 48 hours. These challenges, coupled with limited diagnostics in the region, have delayed the identification of the underlying cause. Rapid response teams have been deployed to identify the cause of the outbreak and strengthen the response.

The teams are also aiding with the treatment of patients, risk communication and community engagement. Given the clinical presentation and symptoms reported, and a number of associated deaths, acute pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, measles and malaria are being considered as potential causal factors with malnutrition as a contributing factor. Malaria is a common disease in this area, and it may be causing or contributing to the cases. Laboratory tests are underway to determine the exact cause.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough):\n> Whooping cough also known as pertussis or the 100-day cough, is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable bacterial disease. Initial symptoms are usually similar to those of the common cold with a runny nose, fever, and mild cough, but these are followed by two or three months of severe coughing fits. Following a fit of coughing, a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in. The violent coughing may last for 10 or more weeks, hence the phrase \"100-day cough\". The cough may be so hard that it causes vomiting, rib fractures, and fatigue. Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods when they cannot breathe.\n\nOn 22 November 2024, the Ministry of Health of New Zealand [declared](https://www.health.govt.nz/news/whooping-cough-epidemic-declared-across-aotearoa-new-zealand) an epidemic of whooping cough across the country, as cases have been rising with 263 cases over the four weeks from mid October to mid November.",

It will pass if a simple majority who vote on the measure approve it. Since this question will be decided by popular vote, this question essentially asks whether sentiment in California had shifted since the post-Covid housing crisis on whether voters would be inclined to favor rent control. This might be a bellwether on popular attitudes on the housing crisis and progressive sentiment in the United States where people demand the government to take proactive measures to address certain social problems. \r\n\r\nProposition 33 would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, which prevents local governments from enacting rent control on homes built after 1995 or if the tenants move out. Essentially, Proposition 33 will empower local governments to have more available courses of action to reduce rents. Governor Gavin Newsom passed a law in 2019 that capped rent increase in California to 5 percent plus the rate of inflation or a maximum of 10 percent. However, proponents of Proposition 33 argue that this is insufficient.  \r\n\r\nGenerally, tenant advocates support Proposition 33, while landlord interest groups are bankrolling the campaign against it. \r\n\r\nThe conventional wisdom among economists is that rent control will lower the supply of housing since it reduces the profit incentive for developers to produce more housing.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, Proposition 21 was on the ballot, which would authorize cities to enact rent control ordinances. The Proposition only received 40.1 percent approval out of the votes of voted on the proposition. \r\n\r\nSources:\r\nhttps://calmatters.org/housing/2024/10/prop-33-2024-fact-check/\r\nhttps://calmatters.org/election-2020-guide/proposition-21-rent-control/",

Antimony, used in bullets, nuclear weapons production, and lead-acid batteries, is just one of many metals that China has a significant share of global production.\n\nThe announcement follows China's previous export controls [on graphite](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-use-graphite-export-restrictions-encourages-diversification) in 2023 and restrictions on germanium and gallium, two metals used in chipmaking, in response to U.S. efforts to limit China's access to high-end semiconductors. These moves have led some industry experts to speculate that China may soon impose export controls on other critical metals, such as tungsten, which is nearly as hard as a diamond and used in weapons, semiconductors, and industrial cutting machines.\n\nChina's actions are seen by some as retaliatory measures against what it perceives as intrusions into its national interests. As a result, companies in the U.S. and elsewhere are exploring alternatives to reduce their reliance on China for critical metals. However, it remains to be seen whether China will follow through with a blanket implementation of the latest export controls or announce restrictions on additional metals in the near future.",
