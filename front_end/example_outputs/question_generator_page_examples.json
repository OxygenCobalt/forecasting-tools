Recent developments, including the leadership change from Justin Trudeau to Mark Carney in the Liberal Party, have led to discussions of a potential early election. Opposition parties are preparing for a possible snap election, particularly if a motion of no confidence is tabled after Parliament reconvenes on March 24, 2025. The Conservative Party currently holds a strong position in polls, and the Liberal Party's slow candidate nomination process has raised concerns about their readiness for an election.\n\nMark Carney has suggested that the next election may not occur until fall 2025, despite the possibility of an earlier election being triggered by political maneuvers or public sentiment. The Liberal Party's candidate nominations lag behind those of the Conservatives and other parties, which could impact their electoral strategy. Analysts note that if Carney's popularity rises, it may influence more Liberal MPs to participate in the election. Overall, the political landscape is dynamic, with various factors at play that could influence the timing of the next federal election in Canada. \n\nSources:\n- [CFJC Today Kamloops](https://cfjctoday.com/2025/03/18/opposition-parties-gearing-up-for-federal-election-in-anticipation-of-potential-writ-drop-this-weekend/)\n- [The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/3/18/n14461533.htm)\n- [LifeSiteNews](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/canadas-new-pm-mark-carney-hints-next-federal-election-wont-be-until-fall/)\n- [rmoutlook.com](https://www.rmoutlook.com/opinion/editorial-federal-liberal-leadership-race-could-be-final-card-before-early-election-10360784)\n- [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/when-is-the-election-in-canada/)\n- [TVA Nouvelles](https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2025/03/12/elections-federales-canadiennes-date-et-comment-voter)\n- [Toronto.com](https://www.toronto.com/news/canadians-want-to-know-when-an-election-will-be-called-heres-what-we-know/article_c1040570-58a2-5330-9071-a11372207835.html)\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Opposition parties gearing up for federal election in anticipation of potential writ drop this weekend**\nThe next federal election in Canada must be held by October 20, 2025. Polls suggest the Conservatives are in a strong position to form government, ending 10 years of Liberal rule. However, the recent leadership change from Justin Trudeau to Mark Carney has given the Liberals a boost, with speculation about a snap election. Kamloops-Thompson-Cariboo MP Frank Caputo expects no trip to Ottawa, but is unsure if an election will be called before parliament returns. Caputo said, 'I'm expecting no stay in Ottawa. I don't think I will be getting on a plane to be candid.

The Conservative Party has nominated candidates in 258 districts, the New Democratic Party in 217, and the Quebec separatist party in 53 of the 78 districts in Quebec. In contrast, the Liberal Party has only nominated candidates in about half of the districts. According to CBC, Christine de Clercy, a professor of politics at Trent University, attributes the Liberal Party's slow nomination process to the dissatisfaction of many MPs with Prime Minister Trudeau and their decision not to run in the next election. She notes that if Mark Carney becomes the leader of the Liberal Party and his popularity increases rapidly, it may encourage some MPs to change their minds. For example, Industry Minister Anita Anand and MP Wayne Long have switched from not running to running. De Clercy is unsure whether the presence of incumbent MPs will make it harder to recruit new candidates and notes that the background checks may be too short, which could lead to risks such as the exposure of controversial social media posts from a candidate's youth. Although Parliament will not reconvene until March 24, Carney has not yet taken his seat in Parliament and has hinted that he may call an early election. Several senior elected officials believe that Canada needs a government with strong public support to deal with the economic pressure from US tariffs. Anand said on CBC's Power and Politics program on Monday, 'The Prime Minister is committed to the election process, and we very much hope he will continue as Prime Minister with us.' Meanwhile, the opposition parties have already announced that they will table a motion of no confidence in the Liberal government after Parliament reconvenes, which would trigger an early election.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 08:37 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/3/18/n14461533.htm)\n\n**Canadian Federal Election May Be Held Early as Liberal Party Lags Behind in Candidate Nominations**\nThe Canadian federal election may be held earlier than expected, but no party has completed candidate nominations in all 343 electoral districts.

This is despite the fact that, by law, there must be a federal election within five years of the last one, which is currently scheduled for October 20, 2025. Carney's decision to postpone the election is seen as a strategic move, as the Conservative Party is currently ahead of the Liberals in the polls, although the gap has been closing since Carney's leadership win.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 03:01 PM\nSource:[LifeSiteNews](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/canadas-new-pm-mark-carney-hints-next-federal-election-wont-be-until-fall/)\n\n**EDITORIAL: Federal Liberal leadership race could be final card before early election**\nThe selection of Mark Carney as the new Liberal leader and Prime Minister-designate has sparked speculation about an early federal election in Canada. With the deteriorating Canadian-U.S. relationship and the ongoing tariff trade war, many Canadians believe an election is necessary to give the federal government a new mandate to address these concerns. According to an Ipsos poll, 86% of Canadians agree that an election is needed, and a recent Nanos poll showed the Conservatives holding a one-point lead over the Liberals. With Carney's landslide victory, some experts predict that an early election will be called soon after he takes office. The new Yellowhead federal riding, which includes Banff and Canmore, will also be a key battleground in the upcoming election. The riding's centre-left leaning politics may give the Liberals an advantage, but the high cost of living and housing in the valley, exacerbated by U.S. tariffs, could impact local businesses and tourism. As the clock ticks on, Canadians await the next federal election, which is expected to happen before October.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 02:30 PM\nSource:[rmoutlook.com](https://www.rmoutlook.com/opinion/editorial-federal-liberal-leadership-race-could-be-final-card-before-early-election-10360784)\n\n**When Is the Election in Canada?**\nCanada will hold federal elections this year, which will have significant implications for its trade conflict with the US. The elections have caught the attention of people outside of Canada, especially Americans. Justin Trudeau announced in January that he would step down as Canadian prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party, but his opposition to President Donald Trump's tariffs and his proposal for Canada to become the 51st state have rebuilt voter support for the Liberals. The elections will see members of Parliament elected to the country's House of Commons, with a party needing to win 172 seats to achieve a majority. The Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, is currently ahead of the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, in polls. However, the elections can be called earlier by order of the prime minister, and Carney is expected to call an election 'soon.' The country's electoral laws require that the elections be held no later than October 20, 2025, but it is unlikely that they will take that long.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 14, 2025 09:50 PM\nSource:[CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/when-is-the-election-in-canada/)\n\n**Early Canadian Federal Election Possible as Mark Carney Takes Liberal Party Helm**\nThe selection of Mark Carney as the leader of the Liberal Party could lead to an early election in Canada, potentially as early as the end of April 2025. According to Elections Canada, the election period can last between 36 and 50 days, meaning that Canadians could be called to vote as early as April 29, 2025, or as late as October 20, 2025. Justin Trudeau had suspended parliamentary work until March 24, which means that an election could be triggered from that date. 'We will make sure that Canadians have a say in the next government,' said Justin Trudeau. 'It's a great opportunity for Canadians to have a say in the direction of the country,' added \u00c9lections Canada.

Here's what we know**\nWith the Liberal party selecting Mark Carney as their new leader, Parliament remains on pause until March 24. Justin Trudeau remains prime minister until Carney is sworn in. Many Canadians are wondering when the next election will be called. According to Elections Canada, a writ is a formal written order instructing the returning officer in each electoral district to hold an election. 'Polling day must be no earlier than the 36th day and no later than the 50th day after the day on which the writ was issued,' Elections Canada said. This would mean an election sometime at the end of April or in May. A snap election could be called in two ways: once Parliament resumes on March 24, a non-confidence motion could be put on the floor, or if Carney asks Gov. General Mary Simon for the dissolution of Parliament in order to hold an election. Currently, Canada's official federal election date is set for Oct. 20, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 04:52 PM\nSource:[Toronto.com](https://www.toronto.com/news/canadians-want-to-know-when-an-election-will-be-called-heres-what-we-know/article_c1040570-58a2-5330-9071-a11372207835.html)\n\n**Ontario election 2025: And so it begins ...**\nOntario's election campaign has begun, with Premier Ford calling for an early election.

The Progressive Conservatives, led by Ford, currently hold a majority government and 79 of the 124 seats in Queen's Park.

Ford's Progressive Conservative Party already holds a majority with 79 out of 124 seats in the Ontario Legislative Assembly. Ford aims to secure a mandate to deal with potential tariffs imposed by Donald Trump and 'attacks on families, businesses, and our communities.' Meanwhile, Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault has stated that he will respect the scheduled date of October 5, 2026, for the next general elections. Legault has also suggested boycotting American products and surtaxing maple syrup sent to the US in response to potential tariffs. The Quebec government has promised to 'fight to the end' to defend its jurisdiction and the use of the Quebec's sovereignty clause. The Supreme Court of Canada has agreed to hear a challenge to Quebec's secularism law, which prohibits public employees from wearing religious symbols. The law was adopted in 2019 and has been contested by various groups, including the National Council of Canadian Muslims, the English-Montreal school board, and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. Additionally, Quebec City Mayor Bruno Marchand has responded to Elon Musk's alleged Nazi salute by making a peace sign and saying 'We must oppose hate with the best of ourselves.' The tramway project in Quebec has also been a point of contention between Ottawa and Quebec, with the federal government refusing to commit to funding 40% of the estimated $7.6 billion cost. Haroun Bouazzi, a Quebec solidaire member, has returned to the provincial parliament after a two-month absence, following controversy over his claims of witnessing racism in the National Assembly.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[lequotidien.com](https://www.lequotidien.com/actualites/politique/2025/01/25/la-semaine-politique-des-oranges-dans-le-sirop-GPRVE24QOJCYVGKM6LOBKHZU5A/)\n\n**Premier of Canada's most populous province seeks early election because of Trump tariffs threat**\nOntario Premier Doug Ford announced plans to call an early election, citing the need for a strong mandate to fight against tariffs threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Ontario, home to 40% of Canada's population, would be severely impacted by Trump's threatened 25% tariff on Canadian imports. Ford has been actively campaigning against the tariffs, appearing on U.S. television shows and considering measures such as cutting off power supplies to the U.S. and banning U.S. alcohol products.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 04:14 PM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/premier-of-canadas-most-populous-province-seeks-early-election-because-of-trump-tariffs-threat)\n\n\n\n\n# FORECASTS\n\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 years and 3 months, as the question will resolve on June 15, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the election would be held on or after October 20, 2025, as per Canadian law, resulting in a \"No\" outcome.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is if the Liberal Party, under the new leadership of Mark Carney, manages to stabilize its position and avoid triggering an early election. This could happen if the party successfully navigates the no-confidence motion and maintains enough support in Parliament to continue governing without calling an election before June 15, 2025.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if the opposition parties successfully pass a motion of no confidence after Parliament reconvenes on March 24, 2025, leading to the dissolution of Parliament and an election being called within the specified timeframe. Alternatively, Mark Carney could decide to call an early election to capitalize on any potential boost in popularity or strategic advantage.\n\nRationale:\nThe current political climate suggests a heightened possibility of an early election due to the leadership change in the Liberal Party and the opposition's intent to table a no-confidence motion. However, the status quo outcome should be given significant weight, as political systems often resist rapid changes. The new leadership under Mark Carney might seek to stabilize the party and avoid an early election unless strategically advantageous. Given the uncertainty and the potential for strategic maneuvering by both the government and opposition, the probability of an election before June 15, 2025, is not overwhelmingly high but remains plausible.\n\nProbability: 45%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 years and 3 months, as the question resolves on June 15, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that no federal election will be held before June 15, 2025, as the next scheduled federal election is set for October 20, 2025.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Despite the current political dynamics and speculation about an early election, Prime Minister Mark Carney decides to wait until the scheduled election date in October 2025. The opposition parties either fail to pass a motion of no confidence, or they decide to hold off on such a motion due to strategic considerations, such as waiting for more favorable polling conditions or internal party dynamics.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The opposition parties successfully pass a motion of no confidence in the Liberal government after Parliament reconvenes, triggering an early election. Alternatively, Prime Minister Mark Carney, in response to political pressures or strategic calculations, decides to call an early election, scheduling it between March 19, 2025, and June 15, 2025.\n\nRationale: The political landscape in Canada is currently dynamic, with a new Liberal leader, Mark Carney, and significant pressure from the opposition. However, historically, the status quo tends to prevail unless there are compelling reasons for change. The new leadership might want to consolidate power and address internal party issues before risking an early election. Additionally, the logistical challenges of organizing a federal election, especially with incomplete candidate nominations, may delay any immediate election plans. Nevertheless, the possibility of a no-confidence motion or strategic early election call cannot be entirely dismissed.\n\nFinal answer: \"Probability: 30%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 years and 3 months, as the question resolves based on whether a federal election in Canada is held before June 15, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a \"No\" since the next federal election is legally scheduled for October 20, 2025, which is after the specified date range.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is if the current political dynamics remain stable, and no significant events or pressures lead to an early election. The opposition parties may not succeed in passing a motion of no confidence, or the Liberal Party under Mark Carney may decide to wait until the fall to call an election, as hinted by Carney.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if the opposition parties successfully pass a motion of no confidence after Parliament reconvenes, triggering an early election. Alternatively, Mark Carney could decide to call a snap election in response to political pressures, such as gaining a stronger mandate to address economic issues or capitalizing on a temporary boost in popularity.\n\nRationale:\nThe current political landscape suggests some potential for an early election, given the leadership change in the Liberal Party and the opposition's readiness to push for a no-confidence vote. However, historically, the status quo tends to prevail unless there are compelling reasons for change. The hints from Mark Carney about a fall election suggest a strategic preference to delay, which aligns with the status quo outcome. The uncertainty surrounding the opposition's ability to force an early election and the Liberal Party's strategic considerations make it more likely that the election will occur closer to the scheduled date.\n\nProbability: 30%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is until June 15, 2025, which is approximately three months from today, March 19, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a \"No\" outcome, as there is currently no official announcement or confirmed date for a federal election in Canada within the specified timeframe.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the Liberal Party, under the new leadership of Mark Carney, deciding to delay the election until the fall of 2025. This decision could be based on strategic considerations, such as improving their standing in the polls or finalizing candidate nominations. Additionally, if the opposition parties fail to successfully table a motion of no confidence or if Carney chooses not to dissolve Parliament, the election would not occur within the specified timeframe.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve the opposition parties successfully tabling a motion of no confidence in the Liberal government once Parliament reconvenes on March 24, 2025. This action would trigger an early election, potentially scheduled between March 19, 2025, and June 15, 2025. Alternatively, Mark Carney could decide to call an early election to capitalize on any potential momentum or public support following his recent leadership win.\n\nRationale: Given the current situation, the status quo outcome of \"No\" is more likely, as there is no official announcement of an election within the specified timeframe. Although there is speculation and some political maneuvering that could lead to an early election, the world tends to change slowly, and political processes often take time. The possibility of an early election remains, but without concrete developments, the probability of a \"Yes\" outcome is lower.\n\nProbability: 30%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 88 days, as the question resolves based on whether a federal election in Canada is held between March 19, 2025, and June 15, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a \"No,\" as there is currently no official announcement of a federal election scheduled to occur within the specified timeframe.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, deciding to delay the election until later in 2025, possibly in the fall, as hinted by Carney. This could be due to strategic considerations, such as allowing more time to close the polling gap with the Conservatives or to complete candidate nominations.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve the opposition parties successfully tabling a motion of no confidence in the Liberal government once Parliament reconvenes on March 24, 2025. This would trigger an early election, potentially scheduled within the specified timeframe.\n\nRationale:\nGiven the current information, the status quo outcome leans towards a \"No\" as there is no official election announcement yet. However, there are significant political dynamics at play, including the potential for a no-confidence motion and the strategic considerations of the new Liberal leadership under Mark Carney. The opposition's strong position in the polls and their readiness to push for an early election add weight to the possibility of a \"Yes\" outcome. Nonetheless, the world changes slowly, and without concrete developments, the probability of a \"No\" remains higher.\n\nFinal Answer: Probability: 60%\n\n",

A poll by RedBridge indicates that a significant portion of the electorate blames the current Labor government for rising electricity costs, with 53% attributing their financial struggles to Labor's renewable energy policies. Meanwhile, the Coalition's stance on nuclear energy has not gained traction, as public perception of nuclear safety has worsened. The polling landscape shows Labor at a primary vote of 68.5% and the Coalition at 29.4%, marking a notable decline in their combined vote share. The rise of independent candidates and minor parties is also evident, suggesting a fragmentation of traditional party support.\n\nAdditionally, the potential for a hung parliament is highlighted, with the Labor Party expected to lose seats while the Coalition may struggle to gain a majority even if it wins additional seats. Key battlegrounds are identified, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, where both major parties face challenges from independents and minor parties. The Greens maintain a stable national support of around 12%, which could influence Senate outcomes but may not translate to significant gains in the lower house. Overall, the research underscores a complex electoral landscape characterized by shifting voter sentiments and the potential for a minority government. \n\nSources:\n- [Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14512711/Anthony-Albanese-energy-bill-redbridge-poll.html)\n- [Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/adam-bandt-greens-vote-federal-election/105067990)\n- [The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/3/17/n14460769.htm)\n- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2025/mar/18/australian-election-2025-polls-today-opinion-poll-tracker-essential-newspoll-2pp-party-labor-coalition-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-latest)\n- [nichigopress.jp](https://nichigopress.jp/news-item/164314/)\n- [Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-09/wa-election-result-lessons-for-labor-liberals-analysis/105028434)\n- [insidestory.org.au](https://insidestory.org.au/disruption-with-australian-characteristics/)\n- [Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/galleries/article-14416259/Anthony-Albanese-hits-reporter-asking-boring-question.html)\n- [katherinetimes.com.au](https://www.katherinetimes.com.au/story/8885626/key-regional-battlegrounds-seats-in-australias-federal-election/?cs=9676)\n- [rappler.com](https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/newsstand-survey-says-history-will-repeat-itself-senatorial-surveys-2025/)\n- [Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-28/federal-election-when-called-and-where-will-it-be-fought/104825066)\n- [The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/1/27/n14423209.htm)\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Poll blames Albo for huge cost-of-living issue**\nA new poll by RedBridge has found that over half of Australians blame Anthony Albanese's Labor government for their soaring electricity bills, with 53% of voters strongly agreeing or agreeing that Labor's renewable energy policy has pushed their power bills up. The poll also found that Peter Dutton's pro-nuclear stance has failed to win voters over, with the number of Aussies who believe nuclear is unsafe increasing from 35% to 39% over the past year. RedBridge director Tony Barry said the Coalition needs to 'own the economic narrative' to win voters ahead of the election, while Kosmos Samaras, a former Labor strategist, predicted a complex election where the two main parties might race to 70 seats in the House of Representatives rather than 76. 'Basically people are blaming governments and it doesn't matter who is in government they are going to wear the brunt of voters stressed about power bills,' Mr Samaras said. The poll also revealed that 57% of Labor voters believed Australia was headed in the right direction, while 72% of Coalition voters believed the country was heading in the wrong direction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 10:02 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14512711/Anthony-Albanese-energy-bill-redbridge-poll.html)\n\n**Do you recognise this man? Nearly a third of his voters don't**\nA recent survey by Redbridge found that nearly a third of voters who support the Greens do not know who their leader, Adam Bandt, is. Despite this, Bandt enjoys a strong primary vote in his seat of Melbourne, with 50.1% of voters supporting him. The survey also found that younger voters are highly disengaged from politics, with many not following the news or reading newspapers. As a result, politicians are now targeting social media platforms and podcasts to reach these voters. The Greens are also diversifying their policy focus, including on housing, Palestine, and the AUKUS alliance, in an effort to lift their brand awareness and win more seats in the lower house. However, Labor has ruled out a formal deal with the Greens, which may limit their ability to win seats. The survey found that the Greens' national support remains at around 12%, which is enough to secure a strong result in the Senate but not enough to win in the lower house.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 06:00 PM\nSource:[Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/adam-bandt-greens-vote-federal-election/105067990)\n\n**Australian Opposition Leader Considers Referendum to Deport Dual Nationals**\nAustralian opposition leader Peter Dutton has confirmed that if his party wins the election, they will consider holding a referendum to allow the government to deport dual nationals convicted of crimes. Dutton stated, 'You can't go beyond the constitution.' The proposal would give government ministers the power to decide on deportations, but has raised concerns about the government's power. The cost of the referendum has also been a point of contention. Treasurer Jim Chalmers criticized Dutton's move, saying it was an attempt to divert attention from other issues. Senator Jacqui Lambie also expressed concerns, calling the proposal 'expensive and divisive.' However, some within the party have expressed support for the proposal, including Senator Bridget McKenzie, who said, 'The constitution gives us an important mechanism, that if we want to change the constitution, we should ask every Australian citizen for their opinion.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 02:00 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/3/17/n14460769.htm)\n\n**Australian election 2025 polls tracker: Labor v Coalition latest opinion polling results**\nAs the 2025 Australian federal election approaches, political polls are being released regularly.

The poll, conducted from March 3-7, shows that the center-left Labor Party, the current ruling party, maintains a 49% support rate, while the center-right Liberal Party, the main opposition, has a 51% support rate. If the actual election results reflect the poll's findings, the Labor Party would lose 3% of its votes compared to the previous election, resulting in a loss of 7 seats and a total of 70 seats in the 151-member House of Representatives, falling short of the majority (76 seats). Meanwhile, the Liberal Party, with 53 seats, would not be able to form a majority government even if it were to win all 7 seats lost by the Labor Party. In such a scenario, the election would result in a hung parliament, and the party with the most seats would need to form a coalition with smaller parties or independents to gain a majority. This would lead to a highly unstable parliamentary situation, with the ruling party relying on the support of smaller parties to maintain power.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[nichigopress.jp](https://nichigopress.jp/news-item/164314/)\n\n**Emotional Roger Cook says huge election win a 'vindication'**\nWestern Australian Premier Roger Cook declared his party's landslide victory a 'vindication' of their plans for the state.

Cook said, 'This is an emphatic victory for WA Labor and it's a vindication of the strong government that we have provided for the people of Western Australia.' Liberal leader Libby Mettam faced reporters, leaving open the possibility she would step down from the role. Mettam said, 'Whoever the leader is going into the 2029 election they need four years to work as a leader, to build momentum in the community and to have the support of the Liberal Party going forward as well.'

The Liberal Party, on the other hand, has seen a significant decline, with only four seats and a reduced presence in the lower house. According to pollster Kos Samaras, the swing against Labor was 17%, but only 5% of that swing went back to the Liberals, while 1% went to the Nationals. The remaining swing splintered across minor parties and independents, particularly among millennials in the outer suburbs. Samaras attributed this to the cost-of-living pressures and the progressive views of this demographic. The Liberal Party's losses were significant, particularly in seats like Warren-Blackwood, Bateman, Scarborough, and South Perth, which were expected to be easy wins. Labor's victory is seen as a major win, with an emphatic mandate to continue its policy agenda, but it may lose its majority in the upper house and be forced to negotiate with a new-look crossbench. 'The best Labor branch in the country' is how pollster Kos Samaras described WA Labor, citing its ability to win elections and suburban politics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 08, 2025 09:16 PM\nSource:[Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-09/wa-election-result-lessons-for-labor-liberals-analysis/105028434)\n\n**Disruption (with Australian characteristics) \u2022 Brett Evans**\nThe 2025 federal election in Australia may result in a minority government, with the Liberal Party's chances of winning a majority being threatened by the rise of teal independents. The teal movement, led by independent candidates such as Nicolette Boele in the seat of Bradfield, has been gaining momentum, with some polls predicting a 98% chance of minority government. The teals have been successful in winning seats previously held by the Liberal Party, and their numbers are expected to increase in the upcoming election. If the polls are correct, the politicians of Australia will be facing a hung parliament, and the horse-trading will begin. The article also explores the history of minority government in Australia, citing the example of the 1941 election, where two independents brought down the government and led to the election of John Curtin as prime minister. The article concludes that minority government may not be such a bad thing, and that it could bring about better policy ideas and a more representative government.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[insidestory.org.au](https://insidestory.org.au/disruption-with-australian-characteristics/)\n\n**Anthony Albanese hits back at reporter after asking 'boring' question**\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese responded sharply to a journalist's question about the date of the upcoming election, calling it 'so boring'. The election must be held on or before May 17, and experts consider April 12 the most likely date. However, this date coincides with the AFL Gather Round in Adelaide, which may affect voters who will be traveling and unable to cast their ballots. Albanese emphasized his support for four-year fixed terms, but noted that the Liberal Party has opposed referendums to implement this.

Election analyst Ben Raue said there is an 'increasing urban-rural divide' and the Coalition is gaining ground in regional areas. The Coalition needs 19 seats for a majority government and the polls suggest the race is tightening. Key marginal seats include Robertson, Dobell, and Gilmore in New South Wales, as well as Paterson, Hunter, and Shortland in the Hunter region. The Nationals are hopeful of snatching back Calare and Cowper, while Labor's Kristy McBain holds Eden-Monaro on a 6.1 per cent margin. In Victoria, the Coalition is hoping to win back McEwen, Corangamite, and Wannon, while Labor's Susan Templeman holds Macquarie on a 6.3 per cent margin. Pollster Kos Samaras predicts the Coalition to pick up six seats, with 12-14 at this point too close to call.

The surveys show that 10 out of 14 candidates with a statistical chance of winning for Pulse Asia and 12 out of 16 for Octa are from the administration slate. This pattern is consistent with historical data, where the incumbent president's party has consistently won a majority of Senate seats in mid-term elections. However, voters may seek balance in the Senate, as seen in past elections where opposition candidates and independents have been elected. Dr. Ronald Holmes, president of Pulse Asia, noted that the top quarter of candidates seems to be more stable, with Erwin Tulfo leading with 62.8%, followed by Bong Go and Tito Sotto. Professor Ranjit Rye, president of Octa, cautioned that it's premature to make predictions, but noted that candidates with ratings above 40% have a high probability of winning. Rye also mentioned a surge in ratings for TV host and entertainer Ogie Revillame, who he believes has a high chance of winning.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 02:00 AM\nSource:[rappler.com](https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/newsstand-survey-says-history-will-repeat-itself-senatorial-surveys-2025/)\n\n**The seats that will determine if Albanese or Dutton is the next prime minister**\nThe upcoming federal election in Australia will be a closely contested battle between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor Party and the Coalition. Labor currently holds 78 seats, while the Coalition has 57. The Greens and independents hold 15 seats. To win a majority, Labor needs to lose only two seats, while the Coalition needs to win 19 seats. Key battlegrounds include Victoria, where Labor faces threats from the Greens and Liberals, and New South Wales, where Labor is facing issues in the mortgage belt. Tasmania could also be a surprise battleground, with both Labor and the Coalition seeing potential for gains. In Western Australia, Labor faces a high-profile three-cornered contest in the new seat of Bullwinkel. In Queensland, Labor has a poor track record, holding only five of the state's 26 seats. The Coalition is eyeing off two Greens seats, having previously held both. Labor currently holds all five lower house seats in the ACT and NT, but faces a tough battle in the NT seat of Lingiari. Independent David Pocock is likely to face a challenge in the ACT Senate seat. Former Victorian Liberal director Tony Barry estimates the Coalition could win seven seats in various states, while political observers estimate the opposition will need around half a dozen gains in Victoria to govern in majority. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 07:00 PM\nSource:[Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-28/federal-election-when-called-and-where-will-it-be-fought/104825066)\n\n**Albanese Remains Confident in Labor's Chances Despite Latest Newspoll**\nDespite most voters believing the Liberal Party will win the upcoming federal election, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his goal remains to form a majority government, which he acknowledges will be a difficult process. According to the latest Newspoll survey, 53% of voters believe the Liberal Party will win, compared to 47% who support the Labor Party. In terms of two-party preferred voting, the Liberal Party has a 2% lead over the Labor Party government, up from 1% in the previous survey. Albanese remains confident in Labor's chances of winning, saying, 'A Labor victory is precious because, since federation, Labor has only been in office for about a third of the time or less.' 'We currently have 78 seats, and we will work hard to form a majority Labor government, and I believe we can do it. We will fight for it every day, making sure people understand the significance of this election.' The federal election must be held by May 17 at the latest. The Newspoll survey shows that the government's support rate has dropped by 3.1% since the 2022 election. Labor's primary vote support rate has dropped by 2% since December last year, to 31%, while the Liberal Party's support rate remains stable at 39%. Former Deputy Prime Minister and National Party MP Barnaby Joyce said on 7News: 'I won't say we're home and hosed, but it's clear that people are very unhappy with Albanese.' 'The cost of living has crushed them, and they've failed to effectively address it.

This is based on current polling data showing Labor with a significant lead in primary votes and two-party preferred votes, despite some challenges such as cost-of-living issues and dissatisfaction with the government's handling of energy policy. Additionally, historical trends often favor the incumbent party in mid-term Senate elections.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a significant shift in public opinion due to unforeseen events or developments. For example, if the Liberal-National Coalition manages to effectively capitalize on the dissatisfaction with the Labor government's handling of economic issues, particularly cost-of-living pressures, they could gain enough support to win the most seats. Additionally, if the Greens or other minor parties manage to significantly increase their visibility and appeal, perhaps through successful social media campaigns or by addressing key issues like housing and climate change, they could capture a larger share of the vote than expected.\n\nFinal probabilities for the options are as follows:\n\n- Liberal-National Coalition: 25%\n- Australian Labor Party: 60%\n- Australian Greens: 10%\n- Other: 5%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two months, as the Australian Senate election must be held by May 17, 2025. \n\n(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would likely be that the Australian Labor Party wins the most seats in the Senate election. This is based on the current political landscape and polling data, which shows Labor leading in most demographics and maintaining a strong position despite some challenges. The proportional representation system in the Senate tends to favor a diverse range of parties, but Labor's current position suggests they are well-placed to secure a significant number of seats.\n\n(c) An unexpected outcome could occur if there is a significant shift in public opinion due to unforeseen events or effective campaigning by the opposition. For instance, if the Liberal-National Coalition successfully capitalizes on the cost-of-living issues and other economic concerns, they could potentially sway enough voters to win the most seats. Additionally, a surge in support for independents or minor parties could fragment the vote further, potentially leading to a scenario where 'Other' becomes a more significant category. The rise of teal independents and their impact on traditional voting patterns could also contribute to an unexpected outcome.\n\nGiven these considerations, my final probabilities for the options are:\n\nLiberal-National Coalition: 30%\nAustralian Labor Party: 50%\nAustralian Greens: 10%\nOther: 10%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two months, as the Australian Senate election must be held by May 17, 2025. \n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be that the Australian Labor Party wins the most seats in the Senate election.

However, given the proportional representation system used in the Senate elections and the increasing fragmentation of the vote, there is still a possibility for other outcomes. The Liberal-National Coalition remains a strong contender, and the rise of independents and minor parties adds uncertainty to the election results. The Australian Greens, while maintaining a stable support base, are unlikely to surpass the major parties in terms of seats won.

For example, if the Liberal-National Coalition manages to capitalize on economic issues or other weaknesses in the Labor government's policies, they could potentially gain enough support to win the most seats.

The ALP is currently the ruling party, and while there is some dissatisfaction with their handling of certain issues like cost-of-living pressures, they still maintain a significant lead in primary votes according to recent polls. The Coalition, while gaining some ground in certain demographics, is still trailing behind Labor overall.\n\n(c) A description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome could occur if there is a significant shift in voter sentiment due to unforeseen events or developments. For example, if there were a major scandal involving the Labor Party or a significant policy failure that captures public attention, it could lead to a rapid decline in their support. Additionally, if the Liberal-National Coalition manages to effectively capitalize on the cost-of-living issues and presents a compelling alternative to voters, they could potentially gain enough support to win the most seats. Another scenario could involve a surge in support for the Australian Greens or independent candidates, driven by a strong campaign or a significant event that aligns with their platform, leading to a more fragmented Senate composition.\n\nFinal probabilities for the options:\nLiberal-National Coalition: 30%\nAustralian Labor Party: 50%\nAustralian Greens: 15%\nOther: 5%\n\n",

Analysts expect the ECB to implement two more rate cuts in April and June 2025, although there is a consensus that the deposit rate will stabilize at 2% thereafter. The ECB's recent decision to cut rates is attributed to easing inflation concerns, with the Eurozone's inflation rate revised down to 2.3% for February 2025. Despite these cuts, there are warnings from some economists about potential inflationary pressures due to increased government spending, which could limit further rate reductions.\n\nMarket expectations are mixed, with some analysts predicting a pause in rate cuts as economic conditions evolve, particularly in light of rising uncertainty regarding trade policies and fiscal measures. The ECB has emphasized that it will assess incoming data before making further decisions, and while there is a significant expectation for rate cuts in the near term, the potential for inflation to rise could complicate the ECB's monetary policy strategy moving forward. Overall, the research highlights the delicate balance the ECB must maintain between stimulating economic growth and managing inflation risks.\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Eurozone Inflation Rate Downgraded to 2.3% in February**\nThe European Union's statistics agency reported that the Eurozone's consumer price index (HICP) rose by 2.3% in February compared to the same period last year, a slight downward revision from the initial estimate of 2.4%. The revision was mainly due to a correction in the German indicator. This may alleviate concerns that the strong inflationary pressure could prevent the European Central Bank (ECB) from further cutting interest rates. The core inflation rate, excluding food and energy, remained at 2.6%. The market expects a 50-60% probability of a rate cut by the ECB in April, with a complete expectation of rate cuts until June. The ECB currently expects inflation to remain at current levels throughout the year and to decline to its 2% target by the first quarter of 2026.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 10:35 AM\nSource:[\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u65e5\u672c\u7248 \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8](https://www.newsweekjapan.jp/headlines/business/2025/03/542672.php)\n\n**Euro zone February inflation estimate reduced due to Germany revision**\nEurostat revised down the estimated inflation rate for the euro zone in February to 2.3%, mainly due to a revision in Germany. This easing of inflation concerns may not significantly impact the European Central Bank's (ECB) decision on interest rate cuts. The ECB has stated that it will not make a decision until it has collected more data, taking into account factors such as trade tensions, budget spending, and falling energy costs. Markets currently anticipate a 50-60% chance of a rate cut in April, with another cut expected before the end of the year, potentially taking the ECB's deposit rate to 2%. The ECB expects inflation to remain around the current level for the rest of the year before falling to its 2% target in the first quarter of 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 10:28 AM\nSource:[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/euro-zone-february-inflation-estimate-reduced-due-germany-revision-2025-03-19/)\n\n**Potential Euro (EUR) Rise Amid Federal Reserve's Dovish Signals**\nAnalysts predict that if the Federal Reserve's dot plot indicates a faster pace of policy easing, the euro (EUR) could rise further. The euro has been testing the $1.09 mark and may appreciate due to the U.S. economy's weakness, which could lead the Fed to lower its median interest rate expectation for 2025 from 3.9% to 3.6%. The euro's trajectory also depends on the European Central Bank's (ECB) actions, with the ECB unlikely to rush into another rate cut in April. However, a rate cut in June is possible, and the euro could potentially reach the $1.11 level, the pre-Trump trade shock level in Q4, but any appreciation might stall before the White House's proposed 'reciprocal tariffs' take effect on April 2.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 08:23 AM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2742471/potential-euro-eur-rise-amid-federal-reserves-dovish-signals)\n\n**Banks Adjust Daily Deposit Interest Rates in Response to ECB Decision**\nThe European Central Bank has decided to lower the base interest rate to 2.50% on March 6, 2025, aiming to achieve a stable inflation rate of 2% or less.

However, the decreasing interest rates are causing a surge in demand for credit. To mitigate this risk, nearly 90% of new home construction loans in 2024 were fixed-rate loans. The European Central Bank's (ECB) interest rate cut in the past week was a welcome news for borrowers, but a less pleasant one for savers. The ECB has been gradually reducing the base rate from 4% to 2.5% since June 2024. According to Edeltraud Stiftinger, Vice-Governor of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB), the interest rate cuts will be passed on to customers in a similar magnitude. The difference between the interest rates charged by banks for loans and the interest rates paid on deposits has remained relatively unchanged in Austria, averaging 1.56 percentage points in 2024. The interest rate spread in new business remained low, at 1.56 percentage points, similar to the previous years. With the decreasing interest rates, the demand for home construction loans is increasing, with a new credit volume of 6.2 billion euros in the second half of 2024, up from 4.9 billion euros in the same period in 2023. However, most borrowers are opting for fixed-rate loans, as they are still cheaper than variable interest rates. In 2024, only 11% of new home construction loans had variable interest rates, down from 40% in 2019. The OeNB emphasizes the importance of transparency and advises borrowers to choose a financing option that they can afford in the long term.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 02:12 PM\nSource:[Die Presse](https://www.diepresse.com/19478045/oesterreicher-zahlten-lieber-schulden-zurueck-statt-zu-konsumieren)\n\n**EZB to Lower Interest Rates Further, but Not Below 2%**\nThe European Central Bank (EZB) has lowered interest rates six times since the monetary policy shift in summer 2024. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect two more interest rate cuts in April and June, but do not expect interest rates to fall below 2%. The current deposit rate of 2.5% is expected to remain at 2% by the end of the survey period. EZB observers do not expect another interest rate cut in the next year, as they believe that increased spending will increase inflation by the end of 2026. Some experts, such as Marco Wagner from Commerzbank, warn that the EZB may be forced to raise interest rates again at their next meeting. However, others, like Olli Rehn, believe that there is no need to slow down the easing of monetary policy. 'The spending will increase the inflation pressure by the end of 2026,' said Wagner. 'It is not necessarily necessary to slow down the easing,' said Rehn. 'We expect two more interest rate cuts in April and June,' said the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 'However, we do not expect interest rates to fall below 2%,' they added.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 11:03 AM\nSource:[finanzmarktwelt.de](https://finanzmarktwelt.de/ezb-senkt-zinsen-weniger-weil-europa-mehr-ausgibt-umfrage-342479/)\n\n**European Central Bank Expected to Lower Interest Rates Twice in 2025**\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to lower interest rates twice in 2025, in April and June, according to market surveys. However, analysts believe that the deposit rate will remain stable at 2% after the cut, and will not be lowered further. Some economists had previously predicted that the rate could drop to 1.75% in March 2026, but the market is now concerned that the increased government spending in Europe could lead to higher inflation, limiting further easing. The ECB has already implemented six rate cuts in the past year to combat slowing inflation and weak economic growth. Market analysts still expect the rate cuts in April and June, but the deposit rate may remain unchanged after reaching 2%. This adjustment in market expectations is largely due to the increased government spending in Europe. Germany's Commerzbank economist Marco Wagner warned that future inflation pressure may arise by the end of 2026, while Austrian ECB member Robert Holzmann cautioned that there is a possibility of re-raising interest rates in the future. In contrast, Finnish ECB member Olli Rehn believes that the pace of rate cuts does not necessarily need to be slowed down. The market's expectations for further rate cuts have diverged, with some analysts predicting that the ECB may pause rate cuts in April. TD Securities economist said, 'The fiscal stimulus plan is currently being reviewed, and if implemented, it will further boost economic growth.' However, market analysts point out that the increased government spending may push up inflation, and the ECB may therefore be more cautious, avoiding excessive rate cuts that could lead to higher prices again. Market expectations for monetary policy adjustments are changing, with analysts predicting that the eurozone's economic growth rate will be 0.9%, 1.2%, and 1.5% respectively from 2025 to 2027, in line with the ECB's forecast. However, there is still significant uncertainty in the market: the expectation of rate cuts has cooled down, and even a pause in rate cuts in April is possible. Trade tensions may also weigh on the eurozone's economic growth. TD Securities economist said, 'Trade barriers are affecting market expectations.' The latest data shows that the eurozone's inflation expectations for 2025-2027 are 2.2%, 2.0%, and 2.1% respectively, slightly higher than the previous month's forecast, indicating that the market's concerns about future price trends are increasing. In the short term, the weakening of rate cut expectations is reducing the euro's attractiveness: as the ECB is expected to further lower interest rates, the euro's interest rate advantage is narrowing, leading to a flow of funds to assets with higher yields, and the euro's exchange rate is under pressure. Global market risk aversion may support the euro: if the market is concerned about global economic growth or geopolitical tensions, the euro may be supported by risk aversion demand. The dollar's movement will also affect the euro: if the Federal Reserve accelerates rate cuts in the next few months, it may reduce the pressure on the euro to depreciate. Van Luu, head of foreign exchange and fixed income strategy at Russell Investments, said, 'The market expects the euro to be affected by policy and risk aversion sentiment in the short term, and may continue to fluctuate.' Currently, the market's focus is on the ECB's policy adjustment pace and the impact of fiscal stimulus on inflation. If the ECB unexpectedly slows down rate cuts or inflation data exceeds expectations, the euro may receive temporary support; otherwise, if market expectations for further easing continue to rise, the euro may continue to be under pressure. The ECB's policy choices are currently very delicate, as they need to further lower interest rates to support economic growth while also being cautious of the inflation risks brought by fiscal stimulus. In this context, the euro's exchange rate will be affected by policy uncertainty and market sentiment, and may continue to fluctuate in the future. If the eurozone's economic growth fails to meet expectations or inflation pressure continues to rise, the market may question the ECB's policy path, which will affect the euro's trend. Additionally, global market uncertainty, trade tensions, and the dollar's movement will also be important factors affecting the euro's future fluctuations. In the short term, the market will closely watch the ECB's next move, and if policy adjustments exceed market expectations, the euro may experience more significant fluctuations. In the next few months, euro investors need to pay attention to policy signals, inflation data, and global market risks to determine the direction of the exchange rate.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 07:28 AM\nSource:[\u548c\u8baf\u5916\u6c47](http://forex.hexun.com/2025-03-17/217938700.html)\n\n**Nomura sees ECB cutting rates one more time this year after policy meeting By Investing.com**\nAnalysts at Nomura now predict the European Central Bank (ECB) will cut interest rates just once more this year, in contrast to other brokerages forecasting two cuts. The ECB reduced its key deposit rate by 2.5% at its latest policy meeting, marking its sixth cut since June. Despite this, ECB President Christine Lagarde said either a drawdown or a pause in rate cuts were on the table. The Nomura analysts described the ECB's decision as a 'neutral to marginally hawkish rate cut.' The ECB also lowered its growth projections for 2025 to 0.9% and for 2026 to 1.2%, citing lower exports and ongoing weakness in investment due to high trade policy uncertainty and broader policy uncertainty.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 10:32 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/nomura-sees-ecb-cutting-rates-one-more-time-this-year-after-policy-meeting-3914389)\n\n**ECB cuts interest rates for sixth time since mid-2024**\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has cut interest rates for the sixth time since June, lowering its deposit rate to 2.5% in response to slowing inflation and faltering growth. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that monetary policy is becoming 'meaningfully less restrictive', suggesting that further rate cuts may be on the horizon. However, Lagarde emphasized that the ECB will not pre-commit to further moves, and will instead assess the data to determine the appropriate course of action. The bank is also monitoring the impact of transformational changes to fiscal rules announced by Germany and the European Commission, which aim to boost defence and infrastructure spending. The ECB lowered its 2025 economic growth forecast to 0.9%, citing lower exports and ongoing weakness in investment due to high trade policy uncertainty and broader policy uncertainty. Lagarde noted that disinflation in the euro area remains on track, and that inflation is expected to hit the target of around 2% by early 2026. The ECB's decision is expected to benefit tracker mortgage holders, who will see their rates reduced to 2.65% from 4.5% in September 2023.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 11:37 PM\nSource:[RTE.ie](https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0306/1500555-ecb-interest-rates/)\n\n**ECB lowers interest rates again but hints more cuts in doubt**\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered interest rates for the sixth time since June last year, cutting the benchmark deposit rate to 2.5%. However, the ECB hinted that further rate cuts may be unlikely, citing 'rising uncertainty' due to massive German spending plans and US tariff threats. ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the process of inflation coming down is 'well on track' and that it believes inflation will settle around the central bank's 2% target. The ECB raised its inflation forecast for this year to 2.3% and trimmed its growth forecast for 2025 and 2026 to 0.9% and 1.2% respectively. Isabel Schnabel, an influential ECB board member, said that policymakers are getting 'closer to the point where we may have to pause or halt our rate cuts'. 'We can no longer say with confidence that our monetary policy is still restrictive,' she said. ECB President Christine Lagarde has so far sought to avoid tipping the ECB's hand and could stick with her mantra of making decisions 'meeting-by-meeting'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 08:43 PM\nSource:[Gulf-Times](https://www.gulf-times.com/article/701515/business/ecb-lowers-interest-rates-again-but-hints-more-cuts-in-doubt)\n\n**European Central Bank Cuts Interest Rates for Sixth Consecutive Time**\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to lower interest rates for the sixth consecutive time, reducing the reference rate by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 2.5-2.9%.

The ECB has been lowering interest rates since June last year, considering the inflation problem largely resolved. The ECB states that 'the process of reducing inflation is on the right track', although inflation has slightly increased since October, reaching 2.4% in February in the euro area, above the 2% threshold.

The move aims to support the economy, which is facing concerns about a slowdown due to the Trump administration's plans to raise tariffs. The ECB is committed to keeping inflation at 2% and has been shifting its focus from controlling inflation to stimulating economic activity. The February inflation rate in the eurozone was 2.4%, a five-month low. The ECB last cut interest rates in June 2022, and has since maintained them before resuming rate cuts in September. The move is expected to have a positive impact on the economy, as it will make it easier for households and businesses to borrow money.

The deposit rate is now 2.5%, the lending rate for banks is 2.65%, and the marginal lending rate is 2.9%. This decision was expected by economists and market participants. The ECB reduced interest rates due to the slowdown in inflation in the eurozone. In February, inflation fell for the first time in five months, from 2.5% in January to 2.4% year-over-year. The core inflation rate (excluding food and energy prices) also slowed down to 2.6%. The ECB predicts that prices will continue to rise slowly, with an average inflation rate of less than 2% in 2025. However, experts believe that the period of interest rate cuts is coming to an end. ECB member Isabel Schnabel said that it may be time to pause, as high borrowing costs no longer have as significant an impact on demand and inflation as they did before. In contrast, German Bundesbank head Joachim Nagel believes that further interest rate cuts are not necessary, saying, 'It's better not to rush with this.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[vesti.az](https://www.vesti.az/v-mire/evropeiskii-centrobank-ponizil-stavki-cto-eto-znacit-dlya-ekonomiki-539464)\n\n**ECB Cuts Interest Rates for Sixth Time in a Row**\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered interest rates for the sixth time in a row since June 2024, by 25 basis points.

According to the ECB, the disinflation process is proceeding as planned, with most indicators of core inflation suggesting that inflation is stabilizing at a level of 2% on a sustainable basis. However, the ECB is facing increasing uncertainty about the prospects for the European economy and external factors, particularly geopolitical ones. Some economists believe that the ECB may take a pause in its cycle of monetary policy easing, while others predict that the deposit rate may fall to 1% by the beginning of 2026. 'It will be easy to make a decision today, but the discussions in the governing council will undoubtedly become more heated,' said Sonia Martin, head of the research department for currencies and monetary policy at DZ Bank.

ECB officials have not had significant disagreements on monetary policy easing, but there are diverging views on inflation and the level of support the economy needs. The sudden decision by the Trump administration to withdraw military support from Ukraine and Europe is expected to lead to increased defense spending in the region, with Germany planning to modify its constitution to allow for increased fiscal spending. European leaders will discuss this issue further at a summit in Brussels. ECB decision-making is expected to become more intense, with Sonja Marten, head of foreign exchange and monetary policy research at DZ Bank, saying, 'This may be the ECB's last 'no-brainer' interest rate decision of the year.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 12:41 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

This is based on the current market expectations and analyst predictions that anticipate rate cuts in April and June.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve a sudden increase in inflationary pressures, possibly due to unexpected geopolitical events or significant fiscal stimulus in Europe, leading the ECB to pause or halt further rate cuts. Additionally, if the ECB perceives that the current monetary policy stance is sufficiently accommodative, they might decide against further cuts.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve continued disinflationary trends and weak economic growth data, prompting the ECB to proceed with the anticipated rate cuts in April and June. This scenario aligns with current market expectations and the ECB's recent actions to support economic growth.\n\nRationale:\nThe current status quo suggests that the ECB is likely to cut rates twice more by June 6, 2025, with market expectations and analyst predictions supporting this view. The ECB has already cut rates multiple times and has indicated a willingness to continue easing monetary policy to support growth and reach its inflation target. While there are concerns about potential inflation risks, the recent data shows inflation is trending downward, which supports further rate cuts. Given the ECB's data-dependent approach, unless there is a significant shift in economic conditions, the probability of two more rate cuts remains high.\n\nProbability: 75%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 months and 18 days, from March 19, 2025, to June 6, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a \"Yes\" outcome. The ECB has already cut rates in March 2025, and market expectations and surveys suggest at least two more cuts by June 2025, one in April and another in June.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a \"No\" outcome could involve a significant and unexpected rise in inflationary pressures, possibly due to geopolitical tensions or a sudden spike in energy prices, leading the ECB to pause its rate-cutting cycle. Additionally, if economic data significantly improves, reducing the need for further monetary easing, the ECB might decide against additional rate cuts.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a \"Yes\" outcome would involve the ECB continuing its current trajectory of rate cuts due to persistent low inflation and weak economic growth. The ECB might also be influenced by external factors such as a dovish stance from other major central banks, like the Federal Reserve, or continued economic challenges within the Eurozone that necessitate further monetary easing.\n\nGiven the current information, market expectations, and the ECB's recent actions, the likelihood of the ECB cutting rates at least twice more by June 6, 2025, seems high. The ECB has already demonstrated a willingness to cut rates, and the economic conditions appear to support further easing.\n\nProbability: 80%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 months and 18 days, ending on June 6, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the ECB has already cut rates once in 2025, and analysts expect two more cuts by June 2025. If these expectations hold, the status quo outcome would be a Yes.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve unexpected economic developments such as a sudden increase in inflation due to geopolitical tensions or fiscal stimulus, leading the ECB to pause or halt further rate cuts. Additionally, if the ECB perceives that the current monetary policy is sufficiently accommodative, they may decide not to cut rates further.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve continued disinflationary pressures and weaker-than-expected economic growth, prompting the ECB to proceed with the anticipated rate cuts in April and June. This scenario aligns with the current market expectations and the ECB's recent actions to support economic growth.\n\nRationale: Given the current information, the ECB has already cut rates once in 2025 and is expected to cut rates twice more by June 2025. The market anticipates these cuts, and the ECB has shown a willingness to adjust rates based on economic conditions. While there are concerns about inflation and fiscal spending, the ECB's recent actions and market expectations suggest that further cuts are likely. The status quo outcome, which aligns with market expectations, is a Yes.\n\nProbability: 70%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2.5 months, from March 19, 2025, to June 6, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the ECB will cut interest rates at least twice more by June 6, 2025. This is based on current market expectations and analyst predictions indicating a high likelihood of rate cuts in April and June.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve a significant and unexpected rise in inflation or geopolitical tensions that lead the ECB to pause or halt rate cuts. For example, if inflation data in the coming months show a significant upward trend, or if geopolitical events such as increased trade tensions or military conflicts cause economic instability, the ECB might decide to maintain current rates to avoid exacerbating inflationary pressures.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the ECB following through with the expected rate cuts in April and June, as currently anticipated by market analysts. This could be driven by continued disinflationary trends, weak economic growth, and the ECB's commitment to reaching its inflation target of 2% by early 2026. Additionally, if the global economic environment remains stable and supportive of further monetary easing, the ECB would likely proceed with the planned rate cuts.\n\nRationale: Given the current market expectations and the ECB's recent actions, the status quo outcome is that the ECB will cut interest rates at least twice more by June 6, 2025. The ECB has already shown a pattern of rate cuts, and analysts widely expect further reductions in April and June. While there are potential risks that could alter this path, such as unexpected inflationary pressures or geopolitical tensions, these would need to materialize quickly and significantly to change the ECB's current course. Therefore, the probability of the ECB cutting interest rates at least twice more by June 6, 2025, remains high.\n\nFinal answer: \"Probability: 80%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 months and 18 days, as the deadline is June 6, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a \"Yes\" outcome. The ECB has already cut rates once in 2025, and market expectations and analyst predictions suggest at least two more cuts by June 2025.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a \"No\" outcome could involve a sudden increase in inflationary pressures or geopolitical tensions that lead the ECB to pause or halt further rate cuts. For example, if inflation unexpectedly rises due to increased government spending or external shocks, the ECB might decide to maintain rates to avoid overheating the economy.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a \"Yes\" outcome would involve the ECB continuing its current trajectory of rate cuts due to persistent low inflation and weak economic growth. If inflation remains stable or continues to decrease towards the ECB's target, and economic conditions do not improve significantly, the ECB is likely to proceed with the anticipated rate cuts in April and June.\n\nGiven the current information, including market expectations and the ECB's recent actions, the probability of the ECB cutting interest rates at least twice more by June 6, 2025, is high. The ECB has already demonstrated a willingness to cut rates, and the economic conditions appear to support further easing.\n\nProbability: 80%\n\n",

This marks a decrease from January's rate of 2.5%. The report highlights that core inflation, which excludes volatile items like energy and food, remained at 2.6%, consistent with the preliminary estimate. Various countries within the Eurozone reported differing inflation rates, with France, Ireland, and Finland showing notably lower rates, while Hungary and Romania experienced higher inflation levels. The services sector was identified as the primary contributor to inflation in the Eurozone.\n\nAdditionally, the research notes that investor expectations regarding future inflation trends remain subdued, with a significant portion of European investors anticipating lower inflation in the coming year. The report discusses the potential implications of these inflation figures on monetary policy, particularly concerning the European Central Bank's interest rate decisions, as ongoing inflationary pressures may complicate plans for rate cuts. Overall, the findings suggest a cautious outlook on inflation trends within the Eurozone as of early 2025.\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Euro falls as eurozone inflation sees downward revisions in February**\nThe eurozone inflation rate has been revised lower in February, with headline inflation rising by 2.3% year-over-year, down from 2.5% in January. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, eased to 2.6% from 2.7% in January, its lowest level since January 2022. Despite the easing inflation figures, investor expectations on future price trends remain subdued, with only a net 7% of European investors expecting lower inflation in the eurozone over the next year. The euro fell 0.4% on Wednesday, dipping below the 1.09 level against the dollar ahead of a closely watched Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. European markets are also reacting to Germany's recently announced fiscal stimulus and expanded European defence spending, both of which are seen as potential growth catalysts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 11:27 AM\nSource:[Euronews English](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/19/euro-falls-as-eurozone-inflation-sees-downward-revisions-in-february)\n\n**Eurostat Lowers Inflation Estimate for Eurozone to 2.3% in February**\nEurostat has revised its estimate of the inflation rate in the Eurozone to 2.3% in February, down from 2.4% in the flash estimate on March 3.

The monthly price pressures reached their highest level in the past 10 months. According to Eurostat's estimates, the Eurozone's annual inflation rate decreased from 2.5% in January to 2.4% in February, but still exceeded the predicted 2.3%. The monthly inflation rate increased by 0.5% compared to January, making it the sharpest increase since April 2024. The service inflation rate decreased slightly to 3.7% from 3.9% in January, remaining the highest inflation rate among categories. Food, alcohol, and tobacco inflation increased to 2.7% from 2.3%, while core inflation, excluding energy and services, decreased to 2.6% from 2.7%. Among Eurozone countries, Estonia had the highest annual inflation rate of 5%, followed by Croatia (4.7%) and Belgium (4.4%). Belgium also had the highest monthly increase of 2.4%. ECB's interest rate cut of 25 basis points is expected on March 6, but further easing may be uncertain beyond that date. BNP Paribas economist Stephane Colliac stated, 'From now until summer, energy prices, food, and industrial goods prices are likely to exert upward pressure on inflation, but there may be a limited decline in service inflation, allowing core Eurozone inflation to decrease in the spring and headline inflation to stabilize around 2%.' BNP Paribas expects ECB to make three consecutive quarter-point rate cuts, but warns that core inflation remaining around 3% may slow down future cuts. The euro appreciated by 0.6% against the dollar on Monday morning, reaching 1.0465, and extended its gains after the inflation data release. The euro also received support from the weekend's London summit, where European leaders agreed to coordinate a plan to increase defense spending and continue aid to Ukraine. European bond yields rose as markets digested the combined effect of persistent inflation and increasing government spending expectations. Two-year German Schatz yields rose by 5 basis points to 2.05%, while 10-year Bund yields rose by 6 basis points to 2.45%. The Euro STOXX 50 index rose by 0.6%, while Germany's DAX index rose by 0.8%. Defense stocks led the gains, with Rheinmetall rising by 17.6%, French Dassault Aviation and Thales by 16%, and Italian Leonardo by 15%. In Germany, two Christian Democrat parties and the Social Democratic Party are considering creating two special funds worth hundreds of billions of euros for defense and infrastructure investments, which further boosted defense stocks and bond yields.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 01:37 PM\nSource:[euronews](https://tr.euronews.com/business/2025/03/03/euro-bolgesi-enflasyonu-beklenenden-daha-az-dustu-ecb-faiz-indirimleri-risk-altinda-mi)\n\n**Eurozone inflation dips to 2.4%, but comes in hotter than expected**\nEurozone inflation dipped to 2.4% in February, a slightly hotter read than expected by analysts.

The cooling headline number will be a key factor at the European Central Bank's (ECB) rate-setting meeting, where it is tipped to cut its key interest rate by a quarter point to 2.5%. ECB president Christine Lagarde said, 'The disinflation process is well on track,' strongly hinting at further rate cuts. She added, 'We know the direction of travel,' but emphasized that the speed, timing, and magnitude of future rate moves will be decided meeting by meeting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 10:50 AM\nSource:[Yahoo! Finance](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/eurozone-inflation-latest-104929814.html)\n\n**Eurozone Inflation Prospects Improve, Bolstering Case for Further Rate Cuts**\nThe European Central Bank is expected to lower interest rates to 2.50% for the sixth time since June 2023, but data on consumer price index (CPI) to be released before the meeting may influence the decision. The bank has already lowered interest rates five times since June 2023, and the sixth reduction is seen as a done deal, with the focus now on how much more the bank will do in the coming months. Investors now expect between two and three more rate cuts after the bank's move on March 7, with the bets shifting mainly in response to news from Washington on trade policy, according to a Reuters poll. New data on inflation in the eurozone is expected on Monday, with the annual core inflation rate expected to be 2.3% higher than February 2024, according to a consensus estimate by FactSet. The core inflation rate, excluding energy and food prices, is expected to be 2.6% on an annual basis in February, down from 2.7% in January. In January 2025, the services-driven core inflation (HICP) remained the main driver of headline inflation, accounting for 1.77 percentage points. Food, alcohol, and tobacco accounted for 0.45 percentage points, and energy for 0.18 percentage points. The industrial goods not related to energy contributed 0.12 percentage points. On the other hand, new data on Friday showed that inflation prospects in the eurozone have improved while growth remains weak, bolstering the case for further rate cuts. Borrowing costs have already fallen, but the 20-country bloc is stuck in a recession, with stagnant manufacturing, reluctant consumers, and companies worried about a comprehensive trade war with the US, holding back investment. Despite the central bank's rapid easing, some policymakers have been calling for more caution on further moves, still worried about lingering price pressures in the domestic economy and the bank's potential reversal of years of hard work. New data on Friday showed that inflation prospects in the eurozone have improved while growth remains weak, bolstering the case for further rate cuts. According to the data, there is a slowdown in price growth in some of the largest economies in the bloc, while expectations have also fallen, apparently confirming long-held views that February may be a turning point, with inflation falling in France, the second-largest economy in the eurozone, to its lowest level in four years at 0.9% in February from 1.8% in January. The services inflation rate also fell to 2.1% from 2.5% in France, a crucial shift, as services, the largest component of the consumer price index, had been stable for several months, fueling concerns that inflation may get out of control. A separate survey by the European Central Bank showed that consumers in the eurozone, who had been raising their bets on price growth in the past few months of 2024, have also become more optimistic, cutting their expectations for the next 12 months to 2.6% in January from 2.8%. The numbers seem to confirm the European Central Bank's narrative that price growth is about to turn and will now start to head towards its 2% target, even with borrowing costs already falling. The French economy contracted in the fourth quarter, according to updated numbers on Friday, while German retail sales grew only slightly, adding to a series of recent indicators and surveys pointing to a recession. Even the European Central Bank's own survey painted a bleak picture with consumers betting on a contraction and a decline in real disposable income. However, there were also some signs that the bloc may have hit the bottom and expectations have not deteriorated. Also, the German unemployment rate rose by the smallest margin and less than expected, while French consumer spending also fell less than expected. The European Central Bank's survey also showed a modest improvement in labor market prospects and a slight increase in expectations for consumer spending.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 01, 2025 09:37 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5117312)\n\n**MNI Eurozone Inflation Preview - February 2025**\nThe Eurozone February flash inflation round will be released over three days, starting with Spain on Thursday (Feb 27) and concluding with Germany on Friday (Feb 28).

According to the main components, services are expected to see the highest annual rate at 3.9%, followed by food, alcohol and tobacco at 2.3%, energy at 1.8%, and industrial goods excluding energy at 0.5%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 10:25 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/latest/Euro-zone-inflation-estimated-to-rise-slightly-in-January-48936226/)\n\n**MNI Eurozone Inflation Preview - January 2025**\nThe Eurozone January flash inflation round will set the tone for inflation developments in 2025. The MNI median of sell-side forecasts points to headline inflation at 2.4-2.5% Y/Y and core inflation at 2.7% Y/Y. The ECB is expected to cut rates by 25bps at its January 30 meeting, with a subsequent 25bp cut in March almost fully priced. However, there remains uncertainty around the speed and magnitude of cuts beyond Q1, with inflation data a key input into those decisions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[marketnews.com](https://marketnews.com/mni-eurozone-inflation-preview-january-2025-1738169649065)\n\n\n\n\n# FORECASTS\n\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 2.5 months, as the flash estimate for May 2025 will be published in late May or early June 2025.\n\n(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If inflation remains at the February 2025 level of 2.3%, the outcome would be 2.3%.\n\n(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The inflation rate has been gradually decreasing, with a slight downward trend from 2.5% in January to 2.3% in February. If this trend continues, the inflation rate could be around 2.2% to 2.3% by May 2025.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts have revised their inflation forecasts upward for 2025, and a majority of economists expect inflation to be higher than anticipated. The ECB's target is 2.0%, but there is a consensus that inflation might stabilize around this level in Q2 2025.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant decrease in energy prices due to geopolitical resolutions or breakthroughs in energy technology could lead to a rapid decline in inflation, potentially bringing it below 2.0%.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Escalation of geopolitical tensions leading to increased energy prices and supply chain disruptions could drive inflation higher, potentially exceeding 3.0%.\n\n\"\nPercentile 10: 2.0\nPercentile 20: 2.1\nPercentile 40: 2.3\nPercentile 60: 2.5\nPercentile 80: 2.7\nPercentile 90: 3.0\n\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 months and 2 weeks, as the Eurostat flash estimate for May 2025 will be published in late May or early June 2025.\n\n(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be around 2.3%, which is the latest revised figure for February 2025.\n\n(c) The outcome if the current trend continued would likely be around 2.2% to 2.3%, given the gradual decrease observed from January to February 2025.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets suggest that inflation could be slightly higher than expected, with a majority of economists predicting a potential rise due to factors like wage increases, geopolitical tensions, and increased defense spending.

The Ifo Institute has revised its growth prediction for 2025 down to 0.2%, citing weak consumer confidence and cautious business investments amidst high uncertainty and international competition. The OECD has also reduced its forecast to 0.4%, emphasizing the impact of geopolitical tensions and potential trade barriers from the new U.S. administration. The Bundesbank suggests that the economy will remain stuck in stagnation, with only slight improvements anticipated from increased private consumption and construction services.\n\nAdditionally, the German economy has faced two consecutive years of contraction, with a reported 0.2% decline in GDP for Q4 2024. This downturn is attributed to decreased exports and a lack of robust investment in key sectors. The automotive industry, a significant component of the economy, is particularly struggling, with many companies postponing or canceling investments due to high costs and weak demand. Overall, the research presents a bleak picture of the German economy, characterized by high internal and external uncertainties, which may hinder any potential growth in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Germany's Economic Growth Amidst Uncertainty**\nDespite the challenging economic situation in Germany, the DAX index of German blue chips has grown by almost 50% in 2022-2024. However, the situation has changed significantly, and now the growth is driven by companies other than industrial giants. Germans are known for their melancholy and pessimism, and after five difficult years, many Germans may feel depressed. The pandemic in 2022 was followed by the conflict in Ukraine, which led to a sharp increase in energy prices, and a decrease in demand for German goods in China. Germany's largest economy in Europe last showed growth in the first quarter of 2023, with a mere 0.2% increase. The new US President, Donald Trump, may reduce the number of American troops stationed in Germany, which have ensured its safety for the past 80 years, and impose tariffs on German imports (Trump announced 25% tariffs on EU goods in late February). After the early parliamentary elections on February 23, a right-wing government led by the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz, may come to power. However, a significant number of seats in the Bundestag were won by extreme left and right parties, which may block constitutional reforms necessary to increase defense spending and other important state projects, as said, 'It is a challenging time for Germany.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 05:25 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a Pro](https://pro.rbc.ru/demo/67d432d39a79470804e55b26)\n\n**German Economy Expected to Experience Mini-Growth in 2025**\nThe German economy is expected to experience a mini-growth of 0.2% in 2025, according to the Ifo Institute. The institute's head of economic forecasting, Timo Wollmersh\u00e4user, stated, 'The German economy is stuck.' Despite a recovering purchasing power, consumer sentiment remains subdued, and businesses are investing cautiously. The industry is suffering from weak demand and increased international competition. The OECD has also halved its forecast for German economic growth in 2025 to 0.4%, citing high uncertainty and risks. However, if the planned financial package for defense and infrastructure is implemented, it could have a significant impact on growth in 2026. 'If the financial package is approved, it would certainly have a significant impact on growth in 2026,' said OECD experts Isabell Koske and Robert Grundke. Public investments would increase, and private investments would be stimulated. However, the effects would be less pronounced in 2025 due to the time required to implement investment projects. The Ifo Institute also warned of new problems for the economy due to the US trade policy under President Donald Trump. The new US government has adopted an erratic and protectionist economic policy, which has already had negative effects on the US economy and the global economy. 'The economic situation will continue to be characterized by high internal and external uncertainties at the beginning of 2025,' according to the Federal Ministry of Economics. The ministry cited the 'erratic US trade policy' and the perspectives of the Ukraine war as external uncertainties, and the implementation and design of the financial plans of the Union and SPD as internal uncertainties. 'A reliable economic policy is essential to create trust and stimulate investments,' said Wollmersh\u00e4user. However, Germany's industry is increasingly moving abroad due to high energy and labor costs, geopolitical uncertainties, and a weak economy. According to a survey by the German Industry and Trade Association (DIHK), 40% of companies plan to invest abroad, a slight decline from the previous year. The main reason for this is to reduce costs. 'Germany is at risk of losing its connection,' warned DIHK's head of foreign trade, Volker Treier. 'If companies increasingly move abroad because high energy costs, stifling bureaucracy, and a rising tax burden make it difficult for them here, that's a dangerous signal.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 02:25 PM\nSource:[Frankfurter Allgemeine](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/mehr-wirtschaft/deutsche-wirtschaft-ifo-und-oecd-halbieren-prognose-fuer-2025-110361794.html)\n\n**Ifo Downgrades German Economic Growth Forecast for 2025**\nThe Ifo Institute has revised its economic growth forecast for Germany, predicting a growth rate of 0.2% for 2025, down from the initial estimate of 0.4%.

The prestigious Ifo research institute has revised its forecast for 2025, lowering the estimate of GDP growth to 0.2%, a cut of 0.2 percentage points from the already weak winter forecasts. A desolate scenario that could only see a slight recovery in 2026, with a growth that will not exceed 0.8%. 'The German economy is blocked. Despite the recovery of purchasing power, consumer confidence remains weak and companies are cautious about investments,' said Timo Wollmershauser, head of economic forecasting at Ifo. The picture that emerges is that of a country stuck in a dangerous immobilism, with an industrial sector affected by a stagnant internal and external demand and a growing international competition. The political uncertainties, both in Germany and abroad, amplify the difficulties. 'The new US administration has adopted an irregular and protectionist economic policy. The tariffs on imports of goods from Mexico, Canada and China, already announced, are having initial negative effects on the US and world economy. If further tariff increases were imposed on European products, this could have a significant impact on the German export industry,' Wollmershauser emphasized. On the domestic front, Berlin is stumbling in the dark. Although measures to relaunch infrastructure and the defense sector are being discussed, 'it is not yet clear if and when they will be implemented.' The risk is that uncertainty will continue to dominate, leaving the economy at the mercy of events. 'A reliable economic policy is essential to create confidence and stimulate investments. Companies need security in planning, especially in light of the current challenges posed by structural change in the sector,' Wollmershauser warned. If the entire German economy suffers, the automotive sector - the country's traditional engine - is in full crisis. The data from a survey by the Automotive Industry Association (Vda) among 150 companies shows a dramatic situation: 75% of companies have declared that they are 'postponing, transferring or completely canceling' planned investments in Germany. Only in October 2024 this percentage was 69%, indicating that the situation is worsening rapidly. In addition, almost one company in three (29%) is thinking of relocating abroad, compared to 23% a few months ago. 'Medium-sized automotive companies are increasingly braking investments in Germany,' reads the Vda report. And it is factors such as the 58% of companies citing excessive labor costs, and the 56% complaining of a weak demand both at home and in the rest of Europe that are determining this flight. The mood in the sector is at historic lows. If in October 2024 17% of companies interviewed expected an improvement in 2025, today only 13% have hopes for a better future. On the other hand, 43% predict a worsening of their situation and 45% see no sign of recovery. 'The biggest challenge for medium-sized automotive companies continues to be excessive bureaucracy': a clear warning, with 90% of companies feeling 'heavily' or 'very heavily' burdened by administrative costs. The request of companies to the government is clear: 'The next federal government must make reducing bureaucracy a priority of its work,' said Vda president Hildegard M\u00fcller. But the problem is not just bureaucratic. 'The high energy prices continue to represent a significant disadvantage in terms of location': 61% of companies feel strongly penalized by electricity prices, 50% by gas prices. Eight companies out of ten urgently request measures to lower energy costs, while 75% feel suffocated by taxes. 'While international competition between locations is intensifying and geopolitical pressure continues to grow, Germany's competitiveness as a business location is eroding,' added M\u00fcller. 'However, this difficult situation has remained politically irrelevant for too long. A new government's program must be ambitious and aim for competitiveness with concrete reforms. Economic strength is the foundation for overcoming global challenges and being able to survive in the long term.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 01:27 PM\nSource:[il Giornale.it](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica-economica/germania-palude-75-delle-aziende-automotive-ha-tagliato-2453020.html)\n\n**Germany's GDP Expected to Remain Unchanged in 2025**\nAccording to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW), Germany's GDP in 2025 will remain unchanged from the previous year, indicating a lack of growth. Germany, the largest economy in the eurozone, is expected to face a recession this year, due to increased international competition and potential import tariffs imposed by the administration of US President Donald Trump. The current structural problems facing the German economy are expected to remain unresolved in the short term. The IfW analysts believe that the recession, characterized by a decline in economic growth, reduced production volumes, and rising unemployment, will continue into next year. However, they expect an improvement in 2026, with a 1.5% increase in GDP, up from the previously forecasted 0.9%, driven by a 0.6% increase in growth due to increased government spending, as proposed by the leader of the CDU/CSU bloc, Friedrich Merz. In 2024, Germany's GDP decreased by 0.2%, with a similar decline in the fourth quarter. The Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis) attributes this decline to a deterioration in export indicators, with local exporters shipping 3.4% fewer goods from October to December compared to the third quarter. Additionally, the situation was exacerbated by a decrease in investments in the construction and industrial sectors. In light of these events, the head of the Munich Institute for Economic Research (Ifo), Clemens Fuest, predicts another difficult year for the German economy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 12:31 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/ifw--vvp-germanii-v-2025-godu-ostanetsya-bez-izmenenij-582004.html)\n\n**Germany's Economy Faces Zero Growth in 2025, Experts Warn**\nThe Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW) has predicted that Germany's GDP will remain unchanged in 2025, with a zero growth rate. According to the institute, the German economy will face a full-blown recession this year, due to structural problems, increased international competition, and the threat of import tariffs from the new US administration. The recession is characterized by a sustained decline in economic growth rates, a decrease in production volumes, and an increase in unemployment. Experts believe that the situation will remain critical in 2025, but will start to improve in 2026, with a predicted growth rate of 1.5%. The improvement is attributed to the increase in government spending, advocated by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. In 2024, Germany's GDP decreased by 0.2%, with a similar decline in the fourth quarter. The Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis) linked the decline to a deterioration in export indicators, with a 3.4% decrease in exports in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Additionally, the decline in investments in key sectors, such as construction and industry, has also had an impact. According to Clemens Fuest, head of the Munich Institute for Economic Research (Ifo), 2025 will be another challenging year for the German economy. 'The situation is critical, and we need to take measures to address the structural problems and increase competitiveness,' Fuest said. 'The government's plans to increase spending and reduce bureaucracy are a step in the right direction, but we need to see more concrete actions.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 12:28 PM\nSource:[Lenta.ru](https://lenta.ru/news/2025/03/13/krupneyshey-ekonomike-evropy-sprognozirovali-zastoy/)\n\n**Germany\u2019s GDP Stagnates in Q4 2024, Maintaining -0.2% Quarter-over-Quarter Contraction**\nGermany's GDP stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2024, maintaining a quarter-over-quarter contraction of -0.2%.

According to the bank's experts, 'In the underlying trend, the German economy remains stuck in stagnation.' The positive outlook is due to a slightly stronger demand for industrial products and construction services, as well as a potential increase in private consumption due to rising wages. However, consumer sentiment remains poor due to rising unemployment, leading to continued saving. The export sector may also be less unfavorable due to pre-emptive effects from the threat of US tariffs. In the long term, the Bundesbank sees the intensified trade policy of the US as a risk for global trade and economic growth. The bank warns that reciprocal tariffs could escalate into serious trade conflicts and that the increased uncertainty could already dampen global growth. Last year, the German economy contracted by 0.2% according to preliminary calculations by the Federal Statistical Office, marking the second consecutive recession for Europe's largest economy. For the fourth quarter of 2024, the statisticians calculated that the gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.2% compared to the previous quarter. The Bundesbank believes that the future federal government has room for maneuver to take on additional debt, particularly in the areas of state infrastructure and sustainable financing of defense expenditures. While the debt brake makes an important contribution to securing solid public finances, it is 'generally reasonable to adapt the credit limit of the debt brake to changed framework conditions at a low state debt ratio.' This would require a focused administration that makes decisions quickly and better utilizes the opportunities of digitalization.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 11:15 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Deutsch](https://de.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/roundup-bundesbank-sieht-kleine-konjunkturelle-hoffnungsschimmer-2887559)\n\n**Germany's 2025 Growth Expectations Lowered**\nGermany's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) decreased by 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous quarter, according to preliminary data from the Federal Statistical Office.

This is a stronger decline than initially expected. While consumer spending and government spending increased, exports were 'clearly lower' than in the previous quarter. Economist Sebastian Dullien from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research (IMK) stated, 'The economy is trapped in a stubborn stagnation.' The aggressive industrial policy of China is putting pressure on exports, and threats from US President Donald Trump of new tariffs are unsettling businesses. The economy has shrunk for the second year in a row, with a 0.2% decline in 2024 compared to the previous year. This is the longest recession since more than 20 years, with the economy shrinking for two consecutive years in 2002/2003. There is no end to the weakness in sight, with Commerzbank chief economist J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer stating, 'The first quarter indicators like the Ifo business climate or incoming orders unfortunately do not signal any improvement.' Only a 'bloodless upward movement' is expected from spring. The government has lowered its growth forecast for 2025 to 0.3%, down from 1.1% in the fall. The Bundesbank and the Council of Economic Experts (Sachverst\u00e4ndigenrat) also predict only a mini-growth of 0.2% and 0.4% respectively. A stronger growth of 1.1% is expected for 2026. Consumer spending is not providing sufficient support for the economy, with Thomas Gitzel, chief economist of the VP Bank, stating, 'In such an environment, wallets will not be opened widely.' However, early indicators suggest a bottoming out, and 'positive growth rates may be seen again in the spring months.'

The data also shows that Germany's economy contracted by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous quarter. If GDP continues to decline in the first quarter of 2025, Germany will enter a 'technical recession' for the second time. The central bank attributes the economic growth constraints to multiple factors, including high financing costs, increased economic policy uncertainty, and severe shortages in enterprise capacity. Additionally, declining German industrial competitiveness has led to a further decline in exports.

In its January monthly report, the Bundesbank states: 'It will not be possible for the German economy to escape the prolonged stagnation phase in the first quarter of 2025.' The gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by 0.1% in the fourth quarter, according to an informal estimate by the Federal Statistical Office. The Bundesbank also expects high inflation in January. The industrial sector is expected to have developed particularly weakly in the fourth quarter, as the Bundesbank notes: 'It is under high pressure to adapt to changed structural framework conditions.' Despite some recovery, foreign orders remained very subdued, and the Ifo business climate worsened again. The construction sector also provided few growth impulses, the Bundesbank says: 'The decline in high-rise construction was offset by a more favorable development in civil engineering.' On the other hand, positive impulses are expected from private consumption and the related service sector: 'The significantly increased wages provided room for additional consumption expenses. However, consumer uncertainty persisted and counteracted a stronger recovery in consumption expenses,' explains the Bundesbank. The inflation rate is expected to remain high at the beginning of the year, the Bundesbank calculates: 'This is due to the further increase in the CO2 price for fossil fuels, as well as price increases for the Deutschlandticket and private health insurance.' In the following months, the inflation rate is expected to decline: 'The recently very strong price increase in services will certainly subside, but will remain significantly above its long-term average.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/nachrichten/Bundesbank-Deutsche-Wirtschaft-stagniert-Anfang-2025-48835104/)\n\n\n\n\n# FORECASTS\n\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2-3 months, as the first official estimate for Germany's Q1 2025 GDP growth is likely to be published by Destatis around May 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is a continuation of the current economic stagnation or contraction. Given the recent trend of negative GDP growth in Q4 2024 (-0.2%) and the overall economic challenges facing Germany, the status quo suggests a likelihood of zero or negative growth in Q1 2025.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome (negative or zero GDP growth) could involve continued or worsening global trade tensions, particularly with the US imposing tariffs on European imports, leading to further declines in German exports. Additionally, persistent high energy costs, labor market challenges, and geopolitical uncertainties could exacerbate the economic stagnation, preventing any significant recovery in domestic demand or investment.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome (positive GDP growth) could involve successful implementation of government measures to stimulate the economy, such as increased public spending on infrastructure and defense, which could boost domestic demand and investment. Additionally, a resolution or easing of trade tensions, particularly with the US, could improve export conditions and contribute to a slight economic recovery. A rebound in consumer confidence and spending, driven by rising wages, could also support positive growth.\n\nRationale: The current economic indicators and forecasts suggest a challenging environment for Germany, with multiple reports indicating stagnation or minimal growth. The status quo, characterized by recent negative GDP growth and ongoing economic challenges, suggests a higher likelihood of continued stagnation or contraction. However, the possibility of government intervention and external factors improving could lead to a slight positive growth. Given the slow-changing nature of economic conditions and the weight of current evidence, the probability of positive GDP growth in Q1 2025 remains modest.\n\nFinal answer: \"Probability: 35%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two months, as the first official estimate for Germany's Q1 2025 GDP growth is likely to be published by Destatis in May 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continuation of the current economic stagnation or contraction, as indicated by the recent data showing a -0.2% contraction in Q4 2024. The prevailing economic conditions suggest that the GDP growth for Q1 2025 is likely to remain negative or at best, flat.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome (negative or zero GDP growth) could involve continued weak demand for German exports due to international trade tensions, high energy costs, and structural challenges within the German economy. Additionally, if the US imposes further tariffs on European goods, it could exacerbate the situation, leading to further contraction in the export sector.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome (positive GDP growth) could involve a stronger-than-expected recovery in domestic consumption due to rising wages and increased consumer confidence. Additionally, if there is a resolution to some of the geopolitical tensions or a reduction in trade barriers, it could boost exports and manufacturing, leading to positive GDP growth.\n\nGiven the current economic indicators and the challenges faced by Germany, the status quo outcome of continued stagnation or slight contraction seems more likely. However, the possibility of a slight positive growth cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if there are unexpected positive developments in trade or domestic consumption.\n\nProbability: 30%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two months, as the first official estimate for Germany's Q1 2025 GDP growth is likely to be released by Destatis around mid-May 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is a continuation of the economic stagnation or contraction observed in late 2024, with a likelihood of negative or zero GDP growth for Q1 2025. Recent data indicates a contraction of 0.2% in Q4 2024, and forecasts for 2025 suggest minimal growth or stagnation.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome (negative or zero GDP growth) could involve continued weak demand for German exports, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and trade barriers, particularly from the US. Additionally, domestic challenges such as high energy costs, labor market issues, and bureaucratic hurdles could persist, leading to reduced investment and consumer spending.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome (positive GDP growth) could involve a slight recovery in industrial demand, both domestically and internationally, perhaps due to temporary alleviation of trade tensions or successful implementation of government stimulus measures. Increased private consumption driven by rising wages and improved consumer sentiment could also contribute to positive growth.\n\nRationale: Given the current economic indicators and forecasts, the status quo suggests a challenging environment for Germany's economy in early 2025. The persistent issues of weak exports, high costs, and geopolitical uncertainties weigh heavily on the outlook. However, the possibility of a slight positive growth cannot be entirely ruled out if there are favorable developments in trade or domestic policy. Nonetheless, the likelihood of a significant shift in the economic trajectory within the next two months seems low.\n\nFinal answer: \"Probability: 35%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two months, as the first official estimate of Germany's Q1 2025 GDP growth is likely to be released in May 2025 by Destatis.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a continuation of the current economic stagnation or contraction, as indicated by the recent GDP data showing a -0.2% contraction in Q4 2024 and the general economic outlook for 2025 being weak.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome (negative or zero GDP growth) could involve continued weak demand for German exports, further geopolitical tensions leading to trade disruptions, and domestic challenges such as high energy costs and bureaucratic hurdles that stifle investment and economic activity.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome (positive GDP growth) could involve a slight rebound in industrial production and exports, possibly due to preemptive orders ahead of potential US tariffs, increased private consumption driven by rising wages, or successful implementation of government measures to stimulate the economy, such as infrastructure investments.\n\nRationale: Given the current economic indicators and forecasts, the German economy is facing significant challenges, including weak demand, high energy costs, and geopolitical uncertainties. The status quo suggests a continuation of stagnation or slight contraction. While there are potential positive factors, such as increased wages and possible government interventions, these may not be sufficient to overcome the prevailing negative trends in the short term. Therefore, the probability of positive GDP growth in Q1 2025 is relatively low, but not impossible.\n\nFinal answer: \"Probability: 30%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two months, as the first official estimate for Germany's Q1 2025 GDP growth is likely to be released in May 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a negative GDP growth for Q1 2025. This is based on the current economic indicators, forecasts, and the ongoing challenges faced by the German economy, including weak demand, high energy prices, and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome (negative GDP growth) could involve further deterioration in global trade conditions, such as the imposition of new tariffs by the US, leading to a significant decline in German exports. Additionally, continued high energy costs and weak consumer confidence could suppress domestic demand, exacerbating the economic contraction.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome (positive GDP growth) might involve a sudden and unexpected improvement in global economic conditions, such as a resolution to trade tensions or a significant increase in demand for German exports. Additionally, effective government intervention, such as implementing fiscal stimulus measures or reducing bureaucratic burdens, could boost domestic investment and consumption, leading to positive GDP growth.\n\nRationale: Given the current economic environment and the information provided, the status quo suggests a continuation of negative growth trends. The German economy is facing significant headwinds, including weak demand, high energy costs, and geopolitical uncertainties. While there is a possibility of positive developments, such as effective government intervention or improved global trade conditions, these are less certain and would require substantial changes in the current trajectory. Therefore, the probability of Germany's Q1 2025 GDP growth being positive is relatively low.\n\nFinal answer: \"Probability: 30%\"\n\n",

It highlights that the EUR/USD has recently opened at 1.0936, with European markets outperforming their US counterparts, as evidenced by the DAX reaching a record high and improved ZEW indices. Analysts note a shift in investment trends favoring European markets, which could bolster the Euro. The report also discusses the impact of the Federal Reserve's potential policy easing, with expectations of a rate cut in June, which could further support the Euro against the Dollar. \n\nAdditionally, the research indicates that the EUR/USD is expected to trade within a range of 1.0905 to 1.0970, with a critical resistance level at 1.0950. Analysts from UOB Group suggest that while the Euro has gained ground, the upward momentum may not be strong enough for a decisive breakout. The report also mentions that external factors such as geopolitical developments and economic indicators from both the US and Europe will play a significant role in shaping the exchange rate trajectory. Overall, the analysis reflects a cautious optimism regarding the Euro's performance against the Dollar in the coming months.\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**EUR/USD Exchange Rate Rises as European Markets Outperform US**\nThe EUR/USD exchange rate has opened at 1.0936, with the DAX reaching a new record high of 23,478 points. European markets are outperforming US markets, with the ZEW indices showing a significant increase. The Bank of America's allocation graph shows a divergence in favor of European markets. The global investment community has been underinvesting in Europe, but this is changing. There is a rotation towards 'value' stocks, with high-valued markets being sold and low-valued markets being bought. The European economy is expected to benefit from this trend. Gold has reached a new all-time high, while cryptocurrencies are not benefiting from the current market conditions. The Euro remains in demand against the USD. The 10-year German bond yield is at 2.82%, while the 10-year US Treasury yield is at 4.30%. The IFO business climate index has improved for self-employed individuals and small businesses, with a slight increase in the number of building permits issued in January 2025. The ZEW sentiment indices have reached a record high, with a strong increase in the Eurozone's trade surplus. The US industrial production has increased by 0.7% in February, with a strong increase in capacity utilization. The US import prices have increased by 0.4% in February. Japan's industrial production has decreased by 1.1% in January.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 10:13 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Deutsch](https://de.investing.com/analysis/risiko-der-scheinblute-ohne-massive-reformen-200497079)\n\n**EUR/USD: To trade in a choppy manner between 1.0905 and 1.0970 - UOB Group**\nAccording to UOB Group's FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, the Euro (EUR) is expected to trade in a choppy manner between 1.0905 and 1.0970 vs US Dollar (USD). In the longer run, EUR must break and close above 1.0950 before resuming its rally. The analysts note that despite the recent rise in EUR, upward momentum has not increased significantly, and there is no sign of an imminent pullback. However, they suggest that EUR could test last week's high near 1.0950, but it does not appear to possess enough momentum to break clearly above this level. The analysts also mention that support is at 1.0905, and a breach of 1.0885 would suggest the current upward pressure has eased.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 08:27 AM\nSource:[FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/eur-usd-to-trade-in-a-choppy-manner-between-10905-and-10970-uob-group-202503190827)\n\n**Potential Euro (EUR) Rise Amid Federal Reserve's Dovish Signals**\nAnalysts predict that if the Federal Reserve's dot plot indicates a faster pace of policy easing, the euro (EUR) could rise further. The euro has been testing the $1.09 mark and may appreciate due to the U.S. economy's weakness, which could lead the Fed to lower its median interest rate expectation for 2025 from 3.9% to 3.6%. The euro's trajectory also depends on the European Central Bank's (ECB) actions, with the ECB unlikely to rush into another rate cut in April. However, a rate cut in June is possible, and the euro could potentially reach the $1.11 level, the pre-Trump trade shock level in Q4, but any appreciation might stall before the White House's proposed 'reciprocal tariffs' take effect on April 2.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 08:23 AM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2742471/potential-euro-eur-rise-amid-federal-reserves-dovish-signals)\n\n**EUR/USD ticks into new multi-year high as Fed rate calls looms large**\nThe EUR/USD currency pair rose by one-fifth of one percent to a 23-month high, reaching the 1.0950 region, as market risk appetite turned risk-on ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday. The European Central Bank's President Christine Lagarde will make an appearance on Thursday, and the EU leaders' summit will begin during the trading week. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged, with a potential quarter-point rate reduction anticipated in June. Technical indicators suggest that the pair may enter a consolidation phase before making a definitive move, with resistance at 1.1000 and support at 1.0850 and 1.0800.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 11:19 PM\nSource:[FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/eur-usd-ticks-into-new-multi-year-high-as-fed-rate-calls-looms-large-202503182319)\n\n**USD/JPY Exchange Rate Expected to Remain Stable Amidst Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Meeting**\nThe USD/JPY exchange rate rose to 149.88 yen in the Tokyo market and 149.93 yen in the European market on March 18, but fell to 149.10 yen before closing at 149.30 yen. The exchange rate is expected to remain in the 149 yen range on March 19. The Bank of Japan is likely to maintain its policy interest rate at the upcoming monetary policy meeting on March 19, considering the impact of the Trump administration's tariff policy on the economy and inflation. However, with the consumer price index exceeding 3% year-over-year and the possibility of further wage increases in labor negotiations, there is a high likelihood that the policy interest rate will be raised at the next meeting on April 30-May 1 or June. As one market participant noted, 'The Bank of Japan will carefully examine the impact of the Trump administration's tariff policy on the economy and inflation, making it likely that the policy interest rate will be maintained at this meeting.'\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 11:16 PM\nSource:[\u8ca1\u7d4c\u65b0\u805e](https://www.zaikei.co.jp/article/20250319/804388.html)\n\n**Today's Foreign Exchange Market Points: Euro Edition**\nThe Euro has seen significant fluctuations in value, dropping to 1.0341 USD in 2017 and rising to 1.2537 USD in 2018, before falling to 0.9536 in 2022 and rebounding to the 1.1 USD range by 2024. The Euro-Yen exchange rate also experienced a sharp decline to 109.57 yen in 2016 following the UK's decision to leave the EU, but later rose to 137.50 yen in 2018. The rate has since continued to rise, reaching 175.16 yen in 2024. The European Central Bank (ECB) may suspend interest rate cuts after April, which could limit the expansion of risk-averse Euro-selling and Yen-buying. Factors driving Euro-selling include uncertainty over the European economy, European political instability, and US tariffs. Factors driving Euro-buying include the ECB's potential to suspend interest rate cuts after April, the Bank of Japan's expected pause in additional interest rate hikes after June, and the planned expansion of European countries' fiscal policies.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 10:56 PM\nSource:[\u8ca1\u7d4c\u65b0\u805e](https://www.zaikei.co.jp/article/20250318/804196.html)\n\n**EUR/USD holds ground below 1.0900 ahead of US Retail Sales data**\nThe EUR/USD pair remains steady around 1.0880 ahead of Monday's US Retail Sales data release. The Euro strengthened after Germany agreed on a debt overhaul and a significant increase in state spending. Markets anticipate the Federal Reserve will maintain its current policy stance, with a 75% probability of a quarter-point rate cut by June. The EUR/USD pair could gain support from improving risk sentiment amid reports of a potential ceasefire discussion between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos expressed concerns about Trump's policies generating greater economic uncertainty, while ECB Governing Council member Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau called for the Euro to play a more prominent role on the global stage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 01:00 AM\nSource:[FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/eur-usd-holds-ground-below-10900-ahead-of-us-retail-sales-data-202503170100)\n\n**EUR/USD Forex Signal Today 13/03: Brief Pullback (Chart)**\nThe EUR/USD exchange rate rose to 1.0935, its highest level since November 5, but then pulled back slightly after the US consumer inflation data showed prices eased ahead of Donald Trump's tariffs. The headline consumer price index dropped from 0.5% in January to 0.2% in February, and core inflation dropped from 3.3% to 3.1%. Analysts anticipate the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged and provide direction on when it will start cutting rates. The EUR/USD pair wavered as the market reacted to Donald Trump's tariffs on European steel and aluminum, and the European Union's retaliatory measures. Looking ahead, the next key data to watch will be the upcoming US producer price index (PPI) and initial jobless claims data. The pair has remained above the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level and moved above all moving averages, indicating that bulls are in control for now.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 09:16 AM\nSource:[DailyForex.com](https://dailyforex.com/forex-technical-analysis/2025/03/eurusd-forex-signal-13-march-2025/225568)\n\n**EUR/USD retreats slightly from recent highs as buyers ease back**\nThe EUR/USD currency pair retreated slightly from its recent highs as buyers eased back. This comes after the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation eased more than expected in February, raising hopes for a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve. According to the CME's FedWatch Tool, there are now better than even odds for a rate cut in June. However, despite the cooler CPI readings, there are signs of potential challenges for policymakers, including a surge in natural gas prices and a rise in shelter price inflation. EUR/USD is now facing technical resistance from the 1.0900 handle, a region that previously flummoxed Euro bulls.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 13, 2025 12:02 AM\nSource:[FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/eur-usd-retreats-slightly-from-recent-highs-as-buyers-ease-back-202503122348)\n\n**EUR/USD Analysis and Forecast for the New Week #10**\nThe EUR/USD exchange rate is expected to continue its downward trend, with a possible range of 1.0320 to 1.0420 on Monday. The focus is on the 2023 low at 1.0448, which could be broken if the price falls below 1.02. The author of the analysis notes that the price has found its ceiling at the January high and is now struggling to break through the 1.03 zone. If the price falls below 1.03, further weakness could occur, and the overall downward trend could resume. However, if the downward pressure can be averted, a pullback could lead to a sideways phase between 1.032 and 1.055.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 02, 2025 06:32 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Deutsch](https://de.investing.com/analysis/eurusd-chartanalyse--prognosen-fur-die-neue-woche-10-200496603)\n\n**TRY/USD Exchange Rate Today: 25 February 2025**\nThe Turkish lira (TRY) began the day with a rise, trading at 36.4620. The TRY/USD pair ended the day at 36.4360, just below the previous closing price. At 09:25, the TRY/USD was trading at 36.4620, a 0.1% increase, while the EUR/TRY was up 0.1% at 38.2020 and the GBP/TRY was up 0.1% at 46.0820. The dollar index remained flat at 106.6. Uncertainty over the US administration's trade policies and ongoing news about the Russia-Ukraine war are making it difficult for investors to price the TRY. US President Donald Trump stated that negotiations with Russia and Ukraine are ongoing to end the war, and that a valuable minerals agreement with Ukraine has been reached. Analysts expect the release of personal consumption expenditure data on Friday to influence the market, particularly in terms of the timing of the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) interest rate cuts. Market expectations are that the Fed will cut interest rates in June. Analysts are also watching for sectoral inflation expectations in Turkey, German growth, US housing price index, New York Fed consumer confidence index, and Richmond Fed manufacturing index. From a technical perspective, the dollar index is seen as support at 106 and resistance at 107.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 04:17 AM\nSource:[ekonomim.com](https://www.ekonomim.com/finans/haberler/dolartl-bugun-ne-kadar-25-subat-2025-dolar-euro-fiyatlari-haberi-802134)\n\n**EUR/USD Pair Analysis / Ziraat FX \u2013 (February 17, 2025)**\nAs efforts to end the war in Ukraine continue, US President Trump's actions and statements on tariffs are being closely followed by the markets.

The dollar's pressure has had a significant impact, with the EUR/USD pair closing last week at 1.0492, a 1.6% gain. Technically, the 1.0535 resistance level appears strong, while the 1.0430 support level is below.

The European Central Bank's recent rate cut and potential further easing in March have also contributed to the euro's decline. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that the EU is prepared to respond 'within an hour' to US tariffs, while Bernd Lange, head of the EU's trade committee, suggested reducing the EU's 10% tariff on vehicles to match the US's 2.5% tariff. The dollar's strong performance is expected to continue, with some experts predicting a further decline in the EUR/USD exchange rate to 0.95 by 2025.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Brasil](https://br.investing.com/analysis/-possivel-que-o-eurusd-chegue-a-095-200468704)\n\n**EUR/USD middles post-Fed, US GDP data in the pipe**\nThe EUR/USD currency pair drifted below 1.0400 on Wednesday, but was pushed back into its opening range. The Federal Reserve's latest rate call had little impact, and traders are waiting for actual changes in interest rates or signals that they might be coming. This week, US GDP growth and inflation data will be reported, with median forecasts anticipating a decrease in annualized GDP growth and a rise in inflationary pressures. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the Fed's data-dependent approach to rate adjustments, and denied that President Trump has had direct contact with the Fed. Rate markets have reduced their expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2025, with futures markets pricing in no changes to the federal funds rate until June at the earliest.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 11:37 PM\nSource:[FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/eur-usd-middles-post-fed-us-gdp-data-in-the-pipe-202501292337)\n\n**Dollar Exchange Rate Today: USD/TRY and EUR/TRY Prices**\nThe Turkish lira (TRY) is trading at 35.7296 against the US dollar (USD) after a strong start to the week. The euro (EUR) is selling at 37.4861 TRY, up 0.16% from yesterday. The dollar index is up 0.3% at 107.8. Global markets are experiencing a mixed trend due to the impact of US President Donald Trump's statements on Greenland and the potential for the US to impose additional tariffs on its major trading partners, including Colombia. Analysts are closely watching the interest rate decisions of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) this week. Analysts are concerned that Trump's trade tariff statements may trigger a global trade war and increase inflationary pressures in the US, potentially leading to a policy disagreement between Trump and the Fed. Despite this, expectations for a Fed rate cut in the first half of the year remain strong, with a 96% chance of a 25 basis point cut in June.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 09:04 AM\nSource:[NTV](https://www.ntv.com.tr/ntvpara/dolar-kuru-bugun-ne-kadar-27-ocak-2025-dolar-euro-fiyatlari,pBcspsDOGEu84h1vFVtT_A)\n\n**UBS lowers EUR/USD forecast, sees a parity test soon**\nUBS strategists, Dominic Schnider and Brian Rose, have lowered their forecast for the EUR/USD, expecting the currency pair to test parity soon due to firmer US economic activity. They predict a rebound higher again toward year-end, potentially reaching the 1.05-1.10 range. The stronger US dollar, driven by robust economic data, is pressuring the euro, while Europe's economy remains subdued. UBS notes that a shift in market sentiment would require significant changes in US economic growth, tariff policies, or an uptick in Europe's growth. However, they also point out the potential for US growth to decelerate and the European Central Bank to signal an end to rate cuts by late June 2025, potentially shifting the dynamic in favor of the Euro. Strategists advise that dips below parity may offer opportunities to reduce excessive long positions in the US dollar.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 12:01 PM\nSource:[investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/ubs-lowers-eurusd-forecast-sees-a-parity-test-soon-3821493)\n\n\n\n\n# FORECASTS\n\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 years and 3 months.\n\n(b) The outcome if nothing changed: The EUR/USD exchange rate would likely remain around the current level of approximately 1.0936, as reported in the recent articles.\n\n(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The EUR/USD exchange rate might experience slight fluctuations within the range of 1.0905 to 1.0970, as suggested by UOB Group's FX analysts.

A poll by Spinter tyrimai indicates that the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (LSDP) leads with 12.3% of the vote, followed closely by the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) at 11%. The Nemunas Dawn party, led by Remigijus \u017demaitaitis, is positioned third with 8.9% support, while other parties like the Democrats For Lithuania and the Farmers and Greens Union follow closely behind. The surveys highlight a significant shift in voter preferences, with the ruling coalition facing challenges due to controversies surrounding \u017demaitaitis and his statements regarding Ukraine and defense spending.\n\nAdditionally, the political climate is marked by internal conflicts within the ruling coalition, particularly regarding \u017demaitaitis' controversial remarks about Ukraine and the implications for Lithuania's defense policies. The president and other coalition members have expressed concerns about the future of the coalition, suggesting that the controversies surrounding \u017demaitaitis could lead to significant political changes. Overall, the research provides a snapshot of the current political dynamics in Lithuania as the country approaches its parliamentary elections.

The Lithuanian Special Investigation Service (STT) is investigating whether \u017demaitaitis' trip was related to corruption or a violation of parliamentary rules. \u017demaitaitis is a controversial figure in Lithuanian politics, known for his anti-Semitic remarks and criticism of Ukraine.

Nauseda said, 'If Mr. \u017demaitaitis continues to embarrass himself and the country in front of our international partners and Ukraine, I don't think this coalition has a future. I believe it will change soon, as everyone will realize it's unavoidable.' Nauseda also hinted that \u017demaitaitis has pro-Russian leanings and compared him to former pro-Russian presidential candidate Eduardas Vaitkus. The Lithuanian government has consistently supported Ukraine's fight against Russia, and \u017demaitaitis' comments have been met with criticism from coalition partners and Nauseda. Saulius Skvernelis, the chairman of the Democratic Union 'For Lithuania', suggested that anyone with doubts about the decision to increase defense spending should visit Ukraine. \u017demaitaitis responded by saying he has no reason to visit Ukraine and implied that only those who want to engage in bribery, corruption, and arms trading would go there. Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, believes that \u017demaitaitis is simply filling a information vacuum, as the public lacks information about the source of defense budget funds. He emphasized that the focus should be on the government's actual decisions and actions, rather than \u017demaitaitis' comments. Skvernelis, on the other hand, disagrees and believes that \u017demaitaitis' comments are a deliberate attempt to discredit the country and represent the stance of the 'Nemunas Dawn' party. He also agrees with Nauseda's view that the coalition will not be able to continue with \u017demaitaitis and his party. Skvernelis' party is considering making changes and decisions, and will discuss the matter at their party congress in March, leaving open the possibility of withdrawing from the coalition.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 08:33 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%AB%8B%E9%99%B6%E5%AE%9B%E6%94%BF%E5%A3%87%E5%85%A7%E9%AC%A8-%E5%9F%B7%E6%94%BF%E8%81%AF%E7%9B%9F%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86%E5%85%85%E6%BB%BF%E4%B8%8D%E7%A2%BA%E5%AE%9A%E6%80%A7-081412878.html)\n\n**Lithuanian Politician's Comments on Ukraine Spark Controversy Within Ruling Coalition**\nLithuanian politician Remigijus \u017demaitaitis, chairman of the 'Nemunas Dawn' party, has been criticized for his comments on Ukraine being a corrupt country. \u017demaitaitis' remarks sparked controversy within the ruling coalition, with President Gitanas Nauseda stating that the coalition's future is uncertain.

Given the controversies surrounding the party's leader, Remigijus \u017demaitaitis, and the potential for these to impact voter sentiment negatively, the party might struggle to gain additional support. However, if they manage to navigate these controversies effectively, they could maintain or slightly increase their support. Thus, a range of 8.0% to 10.0% could be plausible.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets, as per the initial prediction, suggest around 11% of the vote. This indicates a belief that the party could perform better than current polling suggests, possibly due to strategic campaigning or shifts in voter priorities.\n\n(e) An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could involve further scandals or controversies involving \u017demaitaitis, leading to a significant loss of public trust and support. Additionally, if the party fails to participate in the election due to internal issues or disqualification, the outcome would be annulled.\n\n(f) An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve a major political shift or event that significantly boosts the party's popularity, such as a successful coalition with other influential parties or a major policy proposal that resonates with a large segment of the electorate.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nPercentile 10: 7.0\nPercentile 20: 8.0\nPercentile 40: 8.9\nPercentile 60: 9.5\nPercentile 80: 10.5\nPercentile 90: 11.5\n```\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as the exact date of the next Lithuanian parliamentary election has not been specified.

Additionally, if the party fails to effectively communicate its platform or address voter concerns, it could see a decrease in support.\n\n(f) An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve a significant shift in public opinion due to external factors, such as a major political or economic event that aligns with the party's platform, or successful coalition-building efforts that increase its visibility and credibility.

However, given the controversies, a slight decrease might be more probable.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets, as mentioned in the background, suggest the party could receive around 11% of the vote.

As of 2025, Lithuania's minimum wage has increased to \u20ac1,038, marking a 12.3% rise from the previous year, making it the highest among the Baltic countries. This increase is part of a broader trend where minimum wages have seen significant hikes in several European nations. Economists have raised concerns that such increases, alongside rising energy costs and inflation, are likely to lead to higher prices for goods and services, potentially resulting in increased inflation rates.\n\nAdditionally, the restaurant sector in Lithuania is facing challenges due to a combination of factors, including the recent minimum wage increase, removal of a reduced VAT rate, and rising food prices, which have led to a notable number of bankruptcies in the industry. The economic landscape is further complicated by changes in the labor code aimed at enhancing employee rights and benefits, which may also influence wage dynamics. Overall, the interplay of these factors suggests a complex economic environment in Lithuania as it navigates wage policies and inflationary pressures.\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Lithuania Ready to Become 'Model' for EU in Energy Security**\nLithuania is ready to become a 'model' for the EU, said the head of the Ministry of Energy, \u017dygimantas Vai\u010di\u016bnas. He stated that the Baltic countries and Poland are willing to become a model for the EU and NATO in terms of strengthening security and energy infrastructure resilience. Vai\u010di\u016bnas acknowledged that the EU countries need to take urgent measures to protect critical energy infrastructure from potential cyber and physical attacks. He cited the 'tense situation' with the security of infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. According to him, protecting critical infrastructure is a crucial element of readiness for potential energy crises, and the EU needs to strengthen protection and resilience by developing new solutions. Vai\u010di\u016bnas believes that funding should not only be provided at the national level but also at the EU level, with a focus on 'regions with increased threats.' He also emphasized the role of renewable energy sources in strengthening energy security and reducing energy costs. The Ministry of Justice of Lithuania has proposed introducing criminal liability for up to 15 years for damaging critical infrastructure in Lithuania. The initiative came after several cases of damage to underwater infrastructure in the Baltic Sea over the past six months. The latest incident occurred in February 2025, when a cable, C-Lion 1, between Finland and Germany was cut. The Commission on National Security has approved a plan for government agencies to respond to damage to critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. According to Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas, underwater cables will be protected using existing resources, but additional funding may be allocated in the future. Director of the Department of State Security, Darius Jauni\u0161kis, acknowledged that Lithuanian intelligence has no information about the intentional damage to several underwater telecommunications and power cables in the Baltic Sea. The European Commission has presented a roadmap for protecting underwater infrastructure in the EU, which includes countermeasures for damage to underwater cables in the Baltic Sea. The plan also includes restrictions on the so-called 'shadow fleet' and its operators. The European Commission plans to monitor the safety of underwater infrastructure using drones and underwater sensors, as well as the introduction of 'smart cables' and the creation of a fleet of repair ships. Additionally, a special hub for collecting and processing information about underwater infrastructure is to be created, and the cooperation of European special services is to be strengthened. This strategy is expected to be implemented in 2025 and 2026. Russia's official representative, Maria Zakharova, responded to reports in the media about Russia's alleged lack of involvement in the damage to underwater cables, saying that she 'awaits the microphone' of those who accused Russia. According to her, Western countries link the so-called 'shadow fleet' of Russia to recent incidents with cables in the Baltic Sea to limit the export of Russian oil and restrict navigation in the Baltic Sea. She believes that the West is concerned about the interests of final energy consumers 'only in words' and continues to undermine global energy security.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 06:07 AM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430](https://lt.sputniknews.ru/20250319/litva-gotova-stat-obraztsovoy-modelyu-dlya-es-zayavil-glava-minenergo-36754320.html)\n\n**Lithuania's Restaurant Sector Faces Challenges Amid VAT Rate Hike and Economic Uncertainty**\nThe number of restaurants in Lithuania is decreasing, with 18 bankruptcies in the sector reported by Creditinfo Lietuva as of March 4, 2025, compared to 61 for the entire previous year. According to the Association of Hotels and Restaurants of Lithuania, the sector has been affected by several shocks, including the removal of the reduced VAT rate, the increase in the minimum monthly wage, the rise in food prices, and the decline in consumption. President of the Association, Egl\u0117 \u0160i\u0161kauskien\u0117, stated, 'Many restaurants simply close without announcing bankruptcy. If you close even ten restaurants in a chain, and there are 40 left, there are reputational problems.' She explained that the sector has been hit by several blows, including the removal of the reduced VAT rate, the increase in the minimum monthly wage, the rise in food prices, and the decline in consumption. \u0160i\u0161kauskien\u0117 is seeking to register a bill in the Seimas to return the reduced VAT rate of 9%, which was in effect from July 2021 to January 2024. However, her plans are complicated by the ongoing tax reform, which proposes to increase the reduced VAT rate to 12%. 'We cannot submit such an amendment now, because this rate is not yet legalized. Realistically, 12% would be good, because if you add alcohol, the real VAT would be 16.5%. We are asking for a reduction only for prepared food, so the gap with the standard 21% would be small. I think there will be no losses for the budget. What the state is losing now, paying unemployment benefits, as well as in the form of debts, lost profits, and other losses,' she explained. According to \u0160i\u0161kauskien\u0117, this reduction is relevant to 80% of the population. Economist \u017dygimantas Mauricas of the Luminor bank agrees that the sector has many problems. 'Prices have risen very sharply, especially in Lithuania. They have risen much more than in Latvia and Estonia. Consequently, consumers, seeing that the growth of prices for goods has slowed down, are not so willing to splurge in restaurants. We are observing a decline in attendance, which is not fully compensated by the rise in prices. Consequently, there are not enough places in the sun for everyone, and some businesses are forced to seek solutions, sometimes deciding to leave. In addition, last year the VAT was returned to the pre-pandemic level. This created an additional burden on the sector. In addition, some companies have outstanding debts for tax refunds that were postponed during the pandemic. As for bankruptcies, their level in this sector has always been relatively high. This is a rather risky, rapidly changing sector. Consumer preferences change, new players appear, and this is a big dynamic. Often these companies are very small. The question is whether the observed wave of bankruptcies is exclusively large or is it rather a return to a more normal state that existed before 2020,' he noted. 'I would not put high hopes on it, because it will not be a popular decision and from a political point of view,' Mauricas said. He also noted that other sectors are also experiencing difficulties: transportation, agriculture, industry. 'I think there will be many legitimate questions about why the catering sector should be reduced now, and not others. By the way, there is another idea - to introduce a reduced tariff for some food products. But this would be a Pandora's box, because then everyone would try to engage in these products. This would be endless discussions that would cause a lot of chaos and little benefit,' he thinks. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 12:55 PM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f](https://lv.sputniknews.ru/20250318/ostanutsya-odni-kebabnye-restorany-litvy-massovo-zakryvayutsya-iz-za-ubytkov-29928786.html)\n\n**Preliminary Projections for Pension Increases in 2026**\nAccording to 'Fakt', the planned increase in benefits for 2026 may be even smaller than expected, with a predicted increase of at least 4.9% considering only inflation. This would raise the minimum pension from 1,878.91 PLN to 1,970.97 PLN. The government is discussing changes to the pension increase mechanism during periods of low inflation. Minister of Family and Social Policy Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-B\u0105k has proposed changes to the pension increase mechanism that would take into account a 20% real increase in wages, aiming to increase benefits for seniors and prevent low increases in the future.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 07:44 AM\nSource:[www.money.pl](https://www.money.pl/emerytury/waloryzacja-emerytur-w-2026-r-oto-pierwsze-prognozy-7136385688951424a.html)\n\n**Lithuania to Freeze Ministry Funding to Increase Military Spending**\nLithuanian authorities plan to freeze the growth of funding for all ministries next year to increase military spending, according to MP Eugenijus Gentvilas. The State Defense Council decided in January to allocate 5-6% of GDP for defense expenses from 2026 to 2030. Additional funding is needed to create an army division by 2030. Gentvilas noted that the state budget of the Baltic republic received 1.5 billion euros more in 2024 than in the previous year. However, he acknowledged that this decision would lead to a reduction in funds allocated for state procurement. Nevertheless, he believes that this initiative will also serve as a stimulus for reviewing the needs of institutions in procurement and their expenses. Gentvilas also emphasized that while the Lithuanian government claims to be striving for economy, it has already included 'meaningless' investments in its plans. He also stated that all Lithuanian citizens should contribute to the financing of defense. To increase military spending, the authorities will have to take various measures, such as borrowing, increasing taxes, and reducing state expenses. Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas stated that the government already has a plan to ensure the growth of military spending in the country. He believes that the authorities 'very seriously' approach this issue. However, he acknowledged that to significantly increase military spending, Lithuania will have to exceed the 3% GDP deficit limit set by the EU. MP Ignas V\u0117gel\u0117 warned that Lithuania may fall into a 'debt spiral' due to the growth of defense spending. He estimated that the Lithuanian government has decided to spend a quarter of the country's annual income, 'without knowing what it can be spent on.' He reminded that debts are disliked because they have to be repaid with interest.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 06:08 AM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430](https://lt.sputniknews.ru/20250318/v-seyme-litvy-pridumali-kak-nayti-milliard-evro-na-oboronu-36744181.html)\n\n**Benefits and Payments for Multi-Child Families in 2025**\nAccording to Sergey Gavrilov, a deputy in the State Duma, in 2025, multi-child families will be entitled to various state benefits and payments. These include tax deductions, indexed maternity capital, subsidies for mortgages, and various allowances. The standard tax deduction for children has been increased. In 2025, parents can expect a tax deduction of 2,800 rubles for the second child and 6,000 rubles for the third and each subsequent child. This will reduce the tax burden on multi-child families. The maternity capital has been indexed by 7.3% since February 1, 2025. The payment amounts are: 676,300 rubles for the first child and 893,800 rubles for the second child (or 217,400 rubles if the payment for the first child has already been received). If a family has already used part of the maternity capital, the remaining amount will also be indexed in 2025. For example, if there were 290,000 rubles left in 2024, this amount will increase to 310,000 rubles in 2025. The monthly allowance for caring for a child under 1.5 years old depends on the family's income and the regional living wage. The minimum allowance is 10,103.83 rubles, and the maximum is 68,995.48 rubles. The allowance is calculated as 40% of the average income of the parent over the past two years, but not less than the minimum established amount. A single allowance for children in 2025 is paid to families with incomes below the living wage. The payment amount is determined taking into account the level of need of the family and can be 50%, 75%, or 100% of the regional living wage, said the head of the State Duma committee. For pregnant women, the allowance is calculated based on 50% of the living wage for able-bodied citizens (on average, 9,665 rubles). If the average per capita income of the family is below the living wage, the payment is increased to 75% (14,497 rubles) or 100% (19,329 rubles) if necessary, noted Gavrilov. Multi-child parents working under a labor contract have the right to an annual paid leave at any convenient time if there are three or more children under 18 years old, and the youngest has not yet turned 14, added Gavrilov. For multi-child mothers, there is the possibility of early retirement. Women who have given birth to three children can retire at 57, four children at 56, and five or more at 50. The mandatory conditions for appointing a pension are a 15-year work experience and 30 pension credits, clarified Gavrilov. For multi-child families with a mortgage, the right to a one-time payment of 450,000 rubles for paying off the mortgage remains, added Gavrilov. These funds can be used to pay off the principal debt or interest on the loan. Using this amount as a down payment on a mortgage is not allowed, reminded the parliamentarian. In addition, multi-child families can count on free medicines for children under 6 years old, free hot meals in schools and vocational educational institutions, compensation for expenses on utility services in the amount of 30-50% depending on the region, and priority right to receive places in kindergartens. In some subjects of the Russian Federation, additional measures of support are provided, such as preferential loans for building housing, free vouchers for sanatoriums, and subsidies for buying school uniforms, said Gavrilov.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 04:20 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421](https://tass.ru/ekonomika/23426453)\n\n**Minimum Wages in Lithuania: Who Receives the Minimum, and Who Earns Up to 10,000 Euros**\nAccording to the State Data Agency, in October last year, 9% (108,100) of all working individuals in Lithuania received the minimum monthly wage (MMW) and a lower gross salary ('on paper'). This is 1.2% less than the previous year. The data shows that a significant portion of the workforce in Lithuania is still struggling to make ends meet.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 02:28 PM\nSource:[DELFI](https://www.delfi.lt/ru/news/economy/zarplaty-v-litve-kto-poluchaet-minimum-a-kto-10-000-evro-120094355)\n\n**The Cost of One Employee in the Baltic Countries**\nAccording to Liga Skuja, a senior tax consultant at Leinonen, the minimum and average salary in each country of the Baltic region is a crucial factor to consider when creating new job opportunities. In 2025, Latvia introduced changes to the tax system, including a minimum wage increase, progressive tax rates, and a fixed minimum exemption. The minimum wage in Latvia is 740 euros, while in Lithuania it is 924 euros (+12% from 2024) and in Estonia it is 886 euros (+8%). The minimum wage has a significant impact on businesses in sectors with low average salaries and low-skilled labor, such as social services, catering, security services, production, and construction. A sudden increase in the minimum wage can affect pricing policy and profitability, as well as employment, forcing companies to find ways to balance rising costs. Interestingly, in Latvia, a separate minimum wage is established for the construction industry - 1050 euros per month or 6.29 euros per hour. Additionally, during the transition period, construction workers, auxiliary workers, and repairmen can be paid a lower wage - at least 930 euros per month (5.57 euros per hour). If the employee's work experience with the employer does not exceed six months, the minimum wage can be 830 euros per month or 4.97 euros per hour. The average salary in the Baltic countries also differs. The average gross salary in the 3rd quarter of 2024 in Lithuania was 2237.90 euros, an increase of 2% from the 2nd quarter, in Estonia it was 1959 euros (-2.4%), and in Latvia it was 1703 euros (+2%). The cost of one employee varies significantly in the Baltic countries due to differences in tax systems. If we consider the net salary received by employees, the picture changes, and the highest net salary will be in Estonia. In Estonia, the tax policy favors those with higher salaries, according to Swedbank experts. For example, a person receiving a salary of 3500 euros after paying taxes in Estonia will receive approximately 2632 euros, in Latvia - about 2464 euros (168 euros less), and in Lithuania - around 2464 euros (346 euros less). These differences are largely related to different tax systems. In Lithuania, a significant tax burden falls on the employee - 20% of the gross salary is withheld as a personal income tax and 19.5% of social insurance contributions, while the employer's additional social insurance costs are minimal - a total of 1.77%. In Latvia and Estonia, the employer covers most of the social contributions - 23.59% in Latvia and 33% in Estonia, so in these countries, most of the salary goes to the employee. These differences can affect investment decisions and labor mobility. Lower employer costs in Lithuania may stimulate the creation of new jobs, while lower employee incomes may increase labor migration to neighboring countries. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 08:05 PM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f](https://lv.sputniknews.ru/20250303/vo-skolko-obkhoditsya-odin-rabotnik-kompanii-v-kazhdoy-iz-stran-pribaltiki-29839462.html)\n\n**Lithuanian Experts Warn of Rising Inflation Due to Energy Costs and Minimum Wage Increase**\nEconomists are warning that companies in Lithuania will increase prices due to rising energy costs, fuel prices, and a minimum wage increase.

The average gross monthly wage rose by 11.2% or EUR 231 to EUR 2,291 in Q2 2024. According to Kristina Zitikyt\u0117, adviser at the Statistics, Analysis and Forecast Department of Sodra, wage growth last year was influenced by the raise of the minimum monthly salary by around 10%. Wage growth was the fastest among workers aged 51-60 and 25-30, standing at 12.4% and 8.1% respectively. Labour income increased the most in education (20.7%) and healthcare (14%) sectors, where there are relatively more older employees.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 01:53 PM\nSource:[DELFI](https://www.delfi.lt/en/en/business/average-wage-in-lithuania-up-by-10-in-2024-120089223)\n\n**Lithuania Enters Top 3 in EU for Online Purchases**\nAccording to Eurostat, 72% of internet users in Lithuania made online purchases for personal use in 2024, a 36% increase from 2014. This is the third highest rate in the EU, after Ireland (96%) and the Netherlands (94%). The most popular online purchases in the EU were clothing, shoes, and accessories, while food delivery from restaurants and fast food chains was the most popular service. Lithuania has seen a significant increase in inflation, with a 3.4% rate in January 2025, a 1.5% increase from December 2024. Economist Alexander Izgorodin predicts that prices will rise in 2025 due to a 12% increase in the minimum wage and higher taxes, particularly on diesel fuel. The Lithuanian economy has been struggling due to the conflict in Ukraine and EU sanctions against Russia, leading to a surge in energy, fuel, and food prices in Europe and the US.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 06:08 AM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430](https://lt.sputniknews.ru/20250224/litva-voshla-v-troyku-liderov-es-po-rostu-onlayn-pokupok-36506428.html)\n\n**Minimum wage: Lithuania and Croatia surpass Malta in 2025**\nMalta's minimum wage has increased by 3.9% in 2025, from \u20ac925 to \u20ac961 per month, but the country has slipped down the rankings.

He notes that prices for both goods and services will rise this year, driven by a 12% increase in the minimum wage and higher taxes, particularly the rising cost of diesel fuel. Izgorodin also predicts that the purchasing power of the population will not grow as strongly as it did in 2024 due to higher inflation, which is expected to reach 2.7% this year, up from 2.1% last year.

This could be influenced by rising inflation and the need to support low-income workers.\n\nRationale: The recent increase in Lithuania's minimum wage by 12.3% suggests a trend towards improving wage standards. However, the economic context, including inflation concerns and increased military spending, may limit the government's ability to announce another increase soon. The status quo outcome is a No, as there is no current announcement or indication of an imminent increase. Given the time frame and economic pressures, the likelihood of a new announcement before June 17, 2025, is uncertain but possible.\n\nFinal answer: \"Probability: 40%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 years and 3 months, as the deadline is June 17, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the minimum wage in Lithuania will not increase again before June 17, 2025, as there is no current announcement or indication of another planned increase.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that the Lithuanian government maintains its current economic policies without further adjustments to the minimum wage, focusing instead on other priorities such as military spending and managing inflation. The government may decide that the recent 12.3% increase is sufficient for the near term, especially given the economic challenges and inflationary pressures.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that the Lithuanian government, in response to rising inflation and economic pressures on low-income workers, decides to announce another increase in the minimum wage before June 17, 2025. This could be driven by political pressure, social unrest, or a strategic decision to boost consumer spending and economic growth.\n\nRationale: The recent increase in the minimum wage by 12.3% suggests that the government is willing to adjust wages to reflect economic conditions. However, the current economic environment in Lithuania, including rising inflation and a focus on military spending, may limit the government's capacity or willingness to implement another increase in the short term. Additionally, the status quo bias suggests that significant policy changes are less likely to occur frequently. Given these factors, while there is a possibility of another increase, it seems less likely within the specified timeframe.\n\nFinal answer: \"Probability: 30%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 years and 3 months, or until June 17, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is No, as there is no current announcement of another minimum wage increase scheduled to take effect before or on June 17, 2025.\n\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: The Lithuanian government does not make any further announcements regarding an increase in the minimum wage before June 17, 2025. Economic conditions, such as inflation and budget constraints, may lead the government to maintain the current minimum wage level to avoid additional financial strain on businesses and the economy.\n\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The Lithuanian government decides to announce another increase in the minimum wage before June 17, 2025, possibly due to continued inflationary pressures, public demand for higher wages, or alignment with broader economic policies aimed at improving living standards and reducing income inequality.\n\nRationale: Given the recent increase in the minimum wage by 12.3% and the broader trend of increasing wages and benefits, there is a possibility of another increase being announced. However, considering the current economic challenges, such as rising inflation and the need to balance military spending, the government may be cautious about further increasing the minimum wage in the short term. The status quo outcome of No is more likely, as changes in minimum wage policy typically do not occur rapidly or frequently.\n\nFinal answer: Probability: 30%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 years and 3 months, until June 17, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is No, as there has been no official announcement of a further increase in the minimum wage by the Lithuanian government beyond the already planned 12.3% increase for 2025.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the Lithuanian government maintaining the current minimum wage without any further increases before June 17, 2025. This could occur if economic conditions, such as inflation or budget constraints, discourage additional wage hikes, or if political priorities shift towards other areas like military spending or energy security.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the Lithuanian government announcing another increase in the minimum wage before June 17, 2025. This could happen if economic conditions improve, allowing for further wage increases, or if there is political pressure to address cost-of-living concerns or align with broader EU wage trends.\n\nRationale: The current status quo is that the minimum wage has already been increased by 12.3% for 2025, and there is no indication from the provided articles that another increase is imminent. Economic challenges, such as rising inflation and the need to increase military spending, may limit the government's ability to further raise the minimum wage. However, given the time frame of over two years, there is still a possibility that changing economic or political conditions could lead to another increase. Nonetheless, the status quo outcome of No is more likely given the current information.\n\nFinal Answer: Probability: 30%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 years and 3 months, until June 17, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is \"No,\" as there has been no official announcement of a further minimum wage increase scheduled to take effect before or on June 17, 2025.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The Lithuanian government decides to maintain the current minimum wage level due to economic uncertainties, such as rising inflation and increased military spending, which could limit the government's ability to implement further wage increases. Additionally, the focus on freezing ministry funding to increase military spending might deprioritize further increases in the minimum wage.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The Lithuanian government announces an additional increase in the minimum wage before June 17, 2025, as part of a broader effort to support low-income workers amidst rising inflation and economic pressures. This could be driven by political pressure to improve living standards or align with EU trends in wage growth.\n\nRationale: The current economic environment in Lithuania is characterized by rising inflation, increased military spending, and economic uncertainties. While there has been a recent increase in the minimum wage, further increases may be constrained by these factors. However, political and social pressures could still lead to an announcement of another increase. Given the time frame and the current status, the likelihood of a further increase being announced before June 17, 2025, is moderate but not guaranteed.\n\nProbability: 40%\n\n",

According to the Bank of Lithuania, the GDP is projected to grow by approximately 2.9% in 2025, driven by an increase in private consumption and labor income. This growth is anticipated to be supported by a robust industrial sector, which saw an 8.80% year-over-year increase in production in January 2025. However, external factors such as potential US tariffs on EU goods could negatively impact Lithuania's GDP growth by up to 1.3 percentage points over the next four years.\n\nAdditionally, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has revised its growth forecast for Lithuania upwards, expecting a growth rate of 2.8% for the year. Despite these positive indicators, challenges remain, including rising military spending that could lead to a \"debt spiral,\" as well as economic pressures from inflation and a declining job vacancy rate. The overall economic landscape suggests a complex interplay of growth potential and risks that will influence Lithuania's GDP trajectory in the near future.\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Chile's GDP Growth Slows in Fourth Quarter, but Exceeds Expectations for 2024**\nChile's GDP for the fourth quarter of 2024 showed a 0.4% increase compared to the previous quarter, a slowdown from the 1.5% increase in the third quarter. This was slightly below the market expectation of a 0.5% increase. The mining sector contracted, while the service and agriculture sectors expanded. Compared to the same period last year, GDP increased by 4.0%, exceeding the market expectation of a 3.7% increase. Capital Economics' Kimberly Spafford said, 'The more timely monthly data suggests that the economy is gaining momentum and entering 2025. Considering that inflation is above target, the central bank is likely to keep the policy interest rate unchanged on the 21st.' The country's GDP for 2024 as a whole increased by 2.6%, accelerating from the 0.5% increase in 2023 and marking the highest growth since 2021. This was above the central bank's forecast of a 2.3% increase, mainly due to exports.

The growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) last year was also aligned with a notable increase in internal demand, which rose 1.3% thanks to increased consumption, as indicated. The good results, especially in the fourth quarter, have allowed the Chilean economy to grow above the estimates of both the Central Bank and economists, whose growth projections for the South American country oscillated between 2.3% and 2.5% for 2024. This is the best result for the country's economy in the three years since President Gabriel Boric took office. In the first year of Boric's presidency, in 2022, the country grew by 2.2%, while the following year it expanded by only 0.5%, according to the revised figures released by the Central Bank on Tuesday. According to the Central Bank, exports were the main contributors to GDP growth, with a 6.6% increase between January and December, with mining, trade, personal services, and transportation standing out. 'The Chilean economy has shown a strong performance in 2024, exceeding expectations and demonstrating its resilience,' said the Central Bank. 'This growth is a testament to the country's economic stability and the effectiveness of our monetary policy,' added the Central Bank. 'We are committed to maintaining a stable and growing economy, and we will continue to work towards this goal,' said the Central Bank.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 07:22 PM\nSource:[primicia.com.ve](https://primicia.com.ve/economia/economia-chilena-crecio-un-26-en-2024-por-encima-de-lo-esperado/)\n\n**Job vacancy rate down to 1.9% in Lithuania in Q4, below EU average - Eurostat**\nAccording to Eurostat, the job vacancy rate in Lithuania decreased to 1.9% in Q4 2024, matching the rate in Q4 2023 but down from 2.1% in the previous quarter.

According to the Association of Hotels and Restaurants of Lithuania, the sector has been affected by several shocks, including the removal of the reduced VAT rate, the increase in the minimum monthly wage, the rise in food prices, and the decline in consumption. President of the Association, Egl\u0117 \u0160i\u0161kauskien\u0117, stated, 'Many restaurants simply close without announcing bankruptcy. If you close even ten restaurants in a chain, and there are 40 left, there are reputational problems.' She explained that the sector has been hit by several blows, including the removal of the reduced VAT rate, the increase in the minimum monthly wage, the rise in food prices, and the decline in consumption. \u0160i\u0161kauskien\u0117 is seeking to register a bill in the Seimas to return the reduced VAT rate of 9%, which was in effect from July 2021 to January 2024. However, her plans are complicated by the ongoing tax reform, which proposes to increase the reduced VAT rate to 12%. 'We cannot submit such an amendment now, because this rate is not yet legalized. Realistically, 12% would be good, because if you add alcohol, the real VAT would be 16.5%. We are asking for a reduction only for prepared food, so the gap with the standard 21% would be small. I think there will be no losses for the budget. What the state is losing now, paying unemployment benefits, as well as in the form of debts, lost profits, and other losses,' she explained. According to \u0160i\u0161kauskien\u0117, this reduction is relevant to 80% of the population. Economist \u017dygimantas Mauricas of the Luminor bank agrees that the sector has many problems. 'Prices have risen very sharply, especially in Lithuania. They have risen much more than in Latvia and Estonia. Consequently, consumers, seeing that the growth of prices for goods has slowed down, are not so willing to splurge in restaurants. We are observing a decline in attendance, which is not fully compensated by the rise in prices. Consequently, there are not enough places in the sun for everyone, and some businesses are forced to seek solutions, sometimes deciding to leave. In addition, last year the VAT was returned to the pre-pandemic level. This created an additional burden on the sector. In addition, some companies have outstanding debts for tax refunds that were postponed during the pandemic. As for bankruptcies, their level in this sector has always been relatively high. This is a rather risky, rapidly changing sector. Consumer preferences change, new players appear, and this is a big dynamic. Often these companies are very small. The question is whether the observed wave of bankruptcies is exclusively large or is it rather a return to a more normal state that existed before 2020,' he noted. 'I would not put high hopes on it, because it will not be a popular decision and from a political point of view,' Mauricas said. He also noted that other sectors are also experiencing difficulties: transportation, agriculture, industry. 'I think there will be many legitimate questions about why the catering sector should be reduced now, and not others. By the way, there is another idea - to introduce a reduced tariff for some food products. But this would be a Pandora's box, because then everyone would try to engage in these products. This would be endless discussions that would cause a lot of chaos and little benefit,' he thinks. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 12:55 PM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f](https://lv.sputniknews.ru/20250318/ostanutsya-odni-kebabnye-restorany-litvy-massovo-zakryvayutsya-iz-za-ubytkov-29928786.html)\n\n**Lithuania to Freeze Ministry Funding to Increase Military Spending**\nLithuanian authorities plan to freeze the growth of funding for all ministries next year to increase military spending, according to MP Eugenijus Gentvilas. The State Defense Council decided in January to allocate 5-6% of GDP for defense expenses from 2026 to 2030. Additional funding is needed to create an army division by 2030. Gentvilas noted that the state budget of the Baltic republic received 1.5 billion euros more in 2024 than in the previous year. However, he acknowledged that this decision would lead to a reduction in funds allocated for state procurement. Nevertheless, he believes that this initiative will also serve as a stimulus for reviewing the needs of institutions in procurement and their expenses. Gentvilas also emphasized that while the Lithuanian government claims to be striving for economy, it has already included 'meaningless' investments in its plans. He also stated that all Lithuanian citizens should contribute to the financing of defense. To increase military spending, the authorities will have to take various measures, such as borrowing, increasing taxes, and reducing state expenses. Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas stated that the government already has a plan to ensure the growth of military spending in the country. He believes that the authorities 'very seriously' approach this issue. However, he acknowledged that to significantly increase military spending, Lithuania will have to exceed the 3% GDP deficit limit set by the EU. MP Ignas V\u0117gel\u0117 warned that Lithuania may fall into a 'debt spiral' due to the growth of defense spending. He estimated that the Lithuanian government has decided to spend a quarter of the country's annual income, 'without knowing what it can be spent on.' He reminded that debts are disliked because they have to be repaid with interest.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 06:08 AM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430](https://lt.sputniknews.ru/20250318/v-seyme-litvy-pridumali-kak-nayti-milliard-evro-na-oboronu-36744181.html)\n\n**The EU's Sanctions Policy: A Recipe for Disaster**\nEuropean politicians and officials have been telling their citizens for three years that with their comprehensive help, Ukraine will inflict a 'strategic defeat' on Russia. To achieve this, huge sums of money were spent and strict anti-Russian and anti-Belarusian sanctions were introduced. As a result, the economy in EU countries has declined, which has had a devastating impact on European stability, lowering the standard of living to a critical level. The situation in the Baltic states is particularly illustrative. For example, in Latvia, the state debt by December 2024 will be 19 billion euros, or 47.7% of GDP, increasing by 1.5 billion euros over the year. Industrial production output decreased by 3% year-on-year, exports fell by 1.9%, and imports fell by 7.4%. The economy contracted by 0.4% mainly due to the decline in exports and investments. In Lithuania, the budget for 2025 was formed with a 3% deficit from GDP, and the state debt will increase by 3.8%. If this trend continues, according to the Bank of Lithuania, by 2027 the state debt will reach 49% of GDP. The decline in cargo traffic in the ports of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia (on average 20% compared to previous years) is also a consequence of the sanctions. The author suggests that the EU should reconsider its relations with Russia and Belarus, and restore normal diplomatic relations, which would be more beneficial for the Baltic states. The article also mentions the growing dissatisfaction of the European population with the current political elites, which may lead to the emergence of new right-wing patriotic forces. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0412\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430 - Rusvesna.su](https://rusvesna.su/news/1742190795)\n\n**Lithuania's GDP growth expected to reach 2.9% this year**\nAccording to the Bank of Lithuania, the country's GDP is expected to grow by almost 2.9% this year, while inflation will reach 3.3%.

The Bank of Lithuania has made only minor adjustments to its previous economic growth forecasts. The country's GDP is expected to grow by 2.9% in 2024, 3% in 2026 and 2027. However, the introduction of 25% US import tariffs on EU goods, as well as EU retaliatory measures, may reduce Lithuania's GDP growth by 0.33-1.3 percentage points over four years, \u0160imkus noted. The Central Bank models this scenario in the event that the US imposes 25% import tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and the EU, 20% on China, and Canada and the EU respond with retaliatory measures. If only Canada responds with retaliatory measures, \u0160imkus said, Lithuania's GDP growth will slow by 0.3-1.2 percentage points in 2025-2029. Under the most lenient scenario, if the US imposes tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico, 20% on China, and only Canada responds with retaliatory measures, Lithuania's economy will slow by 0.2 percentage points over the next four years.

V\u0117gel\u0117 noted that the government has decided to spend a quarter of the country's annual income, 'without knowing what to spend it on.' The parliamentarian also pointed out that Lithuania may exceed the 60% debt-to-GDP ratio, which is the maximum allowed by the EU's Maastricht criteria. He stated that the country's current debt is 38% of GDP, and it will increase to 44% by 2025. V\u0117gel\u0117 criticized the government's economists who believe that the growth of GDP will lead to an increase in the debt limit. He also warned that the country's economic growth will slow down due to the rising inflation and the government's plans to increase taxes to cover the military expenses. The parliamentarian emphasized that the government does not want to reduce its expenses and bureaucracy. The president of Lithuania, Gitanas Naus\u0117da, announced that the country will increase its military expenses to 6% of GDP using a mixed funding model, including internal loans and EU funding.

'The main sector that drove the growth of the Lithuanian economy last year was the services sector, and although the final data is not yet available, our estimate is that the total export of services grew by more than 15% and reached a record level of 30% of GDP,' Maciulis said during a review of the main economic and social indicators of the past year, organized by the State Data Agency on Thursday. 'In this structure of export services, a record share, more than a third, is accounted for by high-value-added services, including financial services, information and communication technology services, and a wide range of business services,' he emphasized. Maciulis also noted that Lithuania has already surpassed other Baltic countries and is approaching the most developed countries of the European Union. 'Only by this indicator we have achieved that the export of high-value-added services accounts for 10% of GDP, and by this indicator we are approaching the most developed countries of the European Union and surpassing almost all countries of the region, including the Baltic countries,' he explained.

Only in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year, GDP grew by 3.6% to 20.2 billion euros. Ukrainian producer of animal feed 'Kormotech' will expand its production capacities in the Kedainiai Free Economic Zone (FEZ) - in early February, the company will begin construction of a new plant worth 60 million euros, which will create around 200 new jobs.

This is typically available a few months after the quarter ends, so likely by mid-2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: The status quo outcome, based on current forecasts and economic indicators, suggests that Lithuania's GDP growth rate for the first quarter of 2025 is expected to be around 2.9%. This is below the 3% threshold.\n\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Lithuania's GDP growth rate remains below 3% due to continued economic challenges such as high inflation, increased military spending leading to budget constraints, and potential negative impacts from international trade tensions, such as US tariffs on EU goods.\n\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Lithuania's GDP growth rate exceeds 3% if there is a stronger-than-expected boost in consumer spending driven by wage increases, a significant rise in exports, and a robust performance in the industrial sector. Additionally, if any negative impacts from international trade tensions are mitigated or reversed, this could further support economic growth.\n\nRationale: The current economic forecasts and indicators suggest that Lithuania's GDP growth rate is expected to be around 2.9% for 2025, which is below the 3% threshold. While there are positive factors such as wage increases and industrial growth, there are also significant challenges, including potential impacts from increased military spending and international trade tensions. Given the slow pace of change in economic conditions, the status quo outcome is more likely, and thus, the probability of the GDP growth rate exceeding 3% is relatively low.\n\nFinal Answer: \"Probability: 30%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1.5 months, as the first quarter of 2025 ends on March 31, and the Lithuanian Department of Statistics will likely release the final GDP growth figures shortly after.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome, based on current forecasts and economic indicators, suggests that Lithuania's GDP growth rate will be around 2.9% for 2025, which is below the 3% threshold required for a \"Yes\" outcome.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve continued economic challenges such as the impact of increased military spending leading to a higher debt burden, reduced consumer spending due to higher VAT rates, and potential negative effects from international trade tensions, such as US tariffs on EU goods.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve stronger-than-expected growth in key sectors such as high-value-added services and industrial production, combined with a boost in consumer spending driven by wage increases, which could push the GDP growth rate above 3% for the first quarter.\n\nRationale: Given the current economic forecasts and the challenges facing Lithuania, the status quo outcome is more likely. The Bank of Lithuania and other institutions have projected GDP growth rates below 3% for 2025, and while there are positive indicators such as industrial production growth, the overall economic environment, including fiscal constraints and external trade pressures, suggests that significant changes would be needed to achieve a growth rate exceeding 3% in the first quarter.\n\nFinal Answer: \"Probability: 30%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two months, as the first quarter of 2025 ends on March 31, and the final GDP growth rate report from the Lithuanian Department of Statistics is expected shortly thereafter.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Lithuania's GDP growth rate for the first quarter of 2025 will be below 3%. This is based on the Bank of Lithuania's forecast of 2.9% GDP growth for the year 2025, which suggests a similar growth rate for the first quarter unless there are significant changes in economic conditions.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve continued economic challenges, such as the impact of increased military spending leading to a higher debt burden, reduced consumer spending due to higher VAT rates, and potential negative effects from international trade tensions, such as US tariffs on EU goods.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve stronger-than-expected economic performance in sectors like industrial production, which showed significant growth in January 2025. Additionally, if consumer spending accelerates more than anticipated due to wage increases and other factors, it could push GDP growth above 3% for the first quarter.\n\nRationale: The current economic forecasts and conditions suggest that Lithuania's GDP growth is likely to be close to, but not exceeding, 3% for the first quarter of 2025. While there are positive indicators, such as strong industrial production growth, other factors like increased military spending and potential trade disruptions pose risks to higher growth. Given the historical tendency for economic forecasts to be conservative and the slow pace of change in macroeconomic conditions, the status quo outcome of below 3% growth is more probable.\n\nFinal Answer: \"Probability: 35%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1.5 months, as the first quarter of 2025 ends on March 31, and the final GDP growth rate for Q1 2025 will likely be reported shortly thereafter by the Lithuanian Department of Statistics.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is that Lithuania's GDP growth rate will not exceed 3% in Q1 2025. The Bank of Lithuania and other sources have projected GDP growth rates around 2.8% to 2.9% for 2025, which is below the 3% threshold.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve continued economic challenges such as the impact of increased military spending, potential negative effects from US tariffs, and ongoing difficulties in sectors like restaurants and transportation. These factors could suppress economic growth, keeping it below 3%.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve stronger-than-expected growth in private consumption and industrial production, as well as positive developments in high-value-added service exports. If these sectors perform exceptionally well, they could push GDP growth above 3%.\n\nConsidering the information available, the status quo suggests that the growth rate will likely remain below 3%. However, there are potential positive developments that could push it above this threshold, though they are less certain.\n\nProbability: 30%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1.5 months, as the first quarter of 2025 ends on March 31, 2025, and the final GDP growth figures are typically released shortly thereafter.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome, based on current information, suggests that Lithuania's GDP growth rate for the first quarter of 2025 is likely to be around 2.9%, as projected by the Bank of Lithuania and supported by other forecasts and economic indicators.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve unforeseen negative economic shocks, such as a significant decline in consumer spending due to increased economic uncertainty or external factors like new trade tariffs or geopolitical tensions that adversely affect Lithuania's exports and overall economic activity.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve stronger-than-expected economic performance in key sectors such as high-value-added services or industrial production, which could boost GDP growth above the current forecast. Additionally, a rapid increase in consumer spending driven by wage growth and benefits could also contribute to exceeding the 3% growth rate.\n\nGiven the current projections and the tendency for economic forecasts to remain relatively stable unless disrupted by significant events, the status quo outcome of a GDP growth rate around 2.9% seems more likely. However, the possibility of exceeding 3% cannot be entirely ruled out if positive economic developments occur.\n\nProbability: 35%\n\n",

It highlights tensions within the ruling coalition, particularly involving the 'Zarya Niamuno' party, which has faced criticism for its controversial statements regarding Ukraine. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda has expressed concerns that such rhetoric could jeopardize the coalition's stability. The LSDP has maintained a cautious approach, emphasizing the need for coalition partners to support the government's commitments to Ukraine, while also addressing internal disagreements.\n\nAdditionally, recent polls indicate that the LSDP is currently leading in public support, but the opposition is gaining momentum, creating pressure for the coalition to address its internal conflicts and maintain unity. The coalition's future appears uncertain, with discussions about potential changes in membership and leadership dynamics. The research suggests that the coalition's ability to navigate these challenges will be crucial in determining its longevity and effectiveness in governance as the 2025 elections approach.\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Lithuanian Seimas Speaker Believes a 'Fifth Column' is Forming in Parliament**\nThe Speaker of the Lithuanian Seimas, Saulius Skvernelis, believes that a 'fifth column' is forming in the parliament. He made this statement after a closed meeting on Tuesday, where the situation in the security sphere was presented to the parliamentarians. Skvernelis emphasized that he did not necessarily mean those deputies who did not support the extension of sanctions against Russians and Belarusians for another year last week. The Seimas had previously supported the proposal to extend national sanctions against citizens of Russia and Belarus for another year, but some members of the 'Zarya Niamuno' party, part of the ruling coalition, and the Union of Peasants, Greens and Christian Families faction did not support it. The leader of the 'Zarya Niamuno' party, Remigijus \u017demaitaitis, stated that his party did not support the extension of sanctions due to the ongoing ban on the import of agricultural products. He suggested that the three Baltic states and Poland should agree on a unified package of sanctions for agricultural products, without exceptions. Lithuania first introduced national sanctions against Belarusian and Russian citizens in 2023, which were renewed and extended last year. After the events in Ukraine, Lithuania strengthened its anti-Russian rhetoric and constantly emphasizes the 'Russian threat' and the need to 'strengthen' the eastern flank of NATO. Lithuania also sees a possible 'security threat' from Belarus, which supports Russia.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 08:40 AM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430](https://lt.sputniknews.ru/20250319/v-seyme-litvy-formiruetsya-pyataya-kolonna-schitaet-spiker-parlamenta-36759283.html)\n\n**Social Democrats Will Not Support Deprivation of Voting Rights for Holders of Gray Passports**\nLauri L\u00e4nenmets, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, confirmed that the party will stick to their previous agreement and support the amendment that denies voting rights to Russian and Belarusian citizens in the upcoming municipal elections. 'Before the constitutional commission meeting, where the urgent change to the Constitution will be discussed, it's essential to emphasize that the Social Democrats are fulfilling their agreements and supporting the deprivation of voting rights for Russian and Belarusian citizens. This was agreed upon in the previous coalition, and the bill was presented in this form, signed by the Social Democratic Party deputies, as well as representatives of the Reform Party and 'Eesti 200', ' said L\u00e4nenmets, a member of the constitutional commission. The initiated bill, supported by 61 deputies, has already passed two readings in the Riigikogu. 'It's irresponsible to change key principles between the second and third readings, including the deprivation of voting rights for stateless persons and citizens of allied states. Breaking previous agreements and rushing at the last minute only increases the likelihood of the amendments failing in parliament,' said L\u00e4nenmets. He emphasized that the Social Democrats will not give in to pressure and will not support the deprivation of voting rights for holders of gray passports. 'I repeat - we do not deviate from the agreements reached and are not willing to negotiate. Now the ball is in the court of Prime Minister Kaja Kallas: she was present at the agreement and is responsible for finding consensus in parliament,' L\u00e4nenmets stressed. The third reading of the constitutional amendments will take place in the Riigikogu on March 26.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 07:23 AM\nSource:[Rus.Postimees.ee](https://rus.postimees.ee/8212350/lyaenemets-social-demokraty-ne-podderzhat-lishenie-prava-golosa-obladateley-seryh-pasportov)\n\n**New Poll: Only Three Parties in the Sejm, Significant Shift Away from PiS**\nAccording to the latest poll, the Civic Coalition would win the parliamentary elections with 34% of the vote, followed by the Law and Justice party with 26.3% and the Confederation with 21.4%.

The proposal, put forward by MPs Laurynas Kasciunas, Audronius A\u017eubalis, and Valdas Rakutis, aims to amend the law on restrictive measures against Russian and Belarusian citizens. Exceptions would be made for truck drivers and cargo transporters, as well as those who travel for objective reasons beyond their control. The lawmakers believe that frequent trips to Belarus by its citizens may lead to recruitment by special services. The proposal is currently being considered by the Lithuanian parliament, which is also reviewing the extension of sanctions against Russian and Belarusian citizens. The current draft law does not propose any changes to the existing restrictions, but rather extends them until May 2, 2026. The proposal will be further discussed in the Committee on National Security and Defense, as well as the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Rural Affairs. The parliament is expected to return to the issue on April 8. The current law suspends the acceptance of visa applications from Russian and Belarusian citizens, except in cases where the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is involved, as well as the issuance of temporary residence permits in Lithuania. The only exception is for those who already hold a valid Schengen or national visa, a residence permit in Lithuania or another EU country. Additionally, arriving Russian and Belarusian citizens are subject to additional security checks. According to the law, Russian citizens without a residence permit in Lithuania are prohibited from purchasing property in the country. Lithuania first introduced national sanctions against Belarusian and Russian citizens in 2023, which were renewed and extended last year. Following the start of the conflict in Ukraine, Lithuania has strengthened its anti-Russian rhetoric, constantly emphasizing the 'Russian threat' and the need to 'strengthen' the eastern flank of NATO. Lithuania also views Belarus as a potential security threat, as it supports Russia, said Laurynas Kasciunas, 'We must be careful and not let our guard down, because the threat is real.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 01:47 PM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430](https://lt.sputniknews.ru/20250317/v-litve-predlozhili-lishat-vnzh-rossiyan-i-belorusov-za-poezdki-na-rodinu-36742315.html)\n\n**SPD to Hold Member Vote on Coalition Agreement**\nThe Social Democratic Party (SPD) is preparing to hold a member vote on the coalition agreement with the Union.

'We are junior partners in the coalition. We would like the senior partners to clearly state their position', Skvernelis said to journalists. 'Is it acceptable for them to continue this behavior, this rhetoric? We will wait for their decision', he added. According to Skvernelis, Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas is not opposed to this development. 'The Prime Minister does not see a problem with this, the Prime Minister is one of the members of the coalition council', Skvernelis noted. Skvernelis said that representatives of his party could work in opposition, and the Lithuanian Union of Farmers and Greens, led by Aurelija Vergeikaite, could join the coalition or replace 'For Lithuania'. 'Mr. Vergeikaite will formulate clear positions in the field of security, foreign policy, and internal policy, and we will be able to discuss them. We do not consider this a barrier to reaching an agreement', Skvernelis said. However, Skvernelis previously stated that his party wanted to avoid cooperation with the 'farmers' because their leader, Ramunas Karbauskis, did not participate in the elections. Karbauskis responded that cooperation with the Democrats would only be possible if Skvernelis was not in the government, as he had previously expelled his allies from the 'farmers' in 2021. As a result, his party remained in opposition. Liberal Seimas member Eugenijus Gentvilas considers Paluckas' indifferent attitude to the scandals involving his coalition partner, Zarya Nyamunasa leader Remigijus Zemaitaitis, to be unjustified. According to Gentvilas, the Prime Minister is 'playing the dove of peace' because he is thinking about the upcoming election of the Social Democratic Party leader and does not want to lose his status as leader. 'We could say that Paluckas is a dandelion, a dove of peace, an embodiment of pacifism. But that's not true. We know Paluckas from 2017, when he was the chairman of the Social Democratic Party and openly spoke about things that didn't please him, for example, about the 'agrarians' led by Karbauskis. (...) He was not a dove of peace, a dove of peace who sits and does nothing, who values calmness', Gentvilas said. In his opinion, if Paluckas had taken a tougher stance towards his coalition partner, he would have acknowledged that he made a mistake by inviting 'Zarya Nyamunasa' to the ruling majority. However, if the Prime Minister becomes the leader of the Social Democratic Party and then takes a more resolute position towards Zemaitaitis, the assessment of his actions will be different. 'And now it's too early for him to acknowledge this mistake, so he naively, primitively portrays himself as a pacifist who likes everything. Whatever Zemaitaitis screams - everything is fine with him', Gentvilas says. However, Gentvilas emphasizes that such behavior from the Prime Minister is not justified. 'I cannot justify when the Prime Minister allows one of the coalition partners to behave in this way - regardless of what goals you pursue in a month. There should be a more serious and principled condemnation of what Zemaitaitis is doing', he thinks.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 05:31 PM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f](https://lv.sputniknews.ru/20250310/litovskaya-koalitsiya-gotovitsya-izbavitsya-ot-zari-nyamunasa-29876709.html)\n\n**Will Social Democrats be Ousted from Government?**\nTensions in the coalition have increased in recent weeks, with the Reform Party and 'Eesti 200' hinting that the government may continue to function without the social democrats.

I have no doubt that this will happen,' he said. According to the preliminary results, the CDU/CSU won 26.8% of the votes, while the right-wing 'Alternative for Germany' (AfD) came second with 20.8%. The Social Democrats (SPD) led by Olaf Scholz came third with 16.4% of the votes. The 'Green' party received 11.6% of the votes, and the 'Left' party received 8.8%. The party 'Union of Sara Wagenknecht - For Reason and Justice' and the Swiss People's Party, which was previously in the government coalition, failed to overcome the 5% barrier. The deployment of the German brigade in Lithuania The German government plans to deploy a brigade in Lithuania by 2027. The military base is planned to be built on the Rudninai polygon, near the border with Belarus. The plan is to deploy a heavy brigade with three maneuverable battalions and all necessary equipment, including support and supply units. According to the plans, the total number of personnel in the country will reach around 5,000 military and civilian personnel, with some Germans arriving with their families. Berlin previously stated that the pace of deployment would depend on the readiness of the receiving side. After the start of the conflict in Ukraine, Vilnius further tightened its anti-Russian rhetoric. Lithuania has been asking the US and NATO to increase the number of troops in the country. In addition, the authorities of the Baltic republic have systematically stated that there is a 'Russian threat' and insist on 'strengthening' the eastern flank of NATO. Moscow has repeatedly expressed concern about the strengthening of the alliance in Europe. The Kremlin noted that Russia does not threaten anyone, but will not leave without attention actions that may be potentially dangerous to its interests.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 02:51 PM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430](https://lt.sputniknews.ru/20250224/v-seyme-nadeyutsya-chto-vybory-v-frg-ne-navredyat-planam-po-brigade-v-litve-36528465.html)\n\n**Lithuanian President Expresses Concerns Over Ruling Coalition's Future**\nLithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda has expressed concerns about the future of the ruling coalition, citing the controversy surrounding Remigijus \u017demaitaitis, the chairman of the 'Nemunas Dawn' party, who has been a member of the coalition since November last year. \u017demaitaitais has been criticized for his comments that Ukraine is a corrupt country, which has led to a rift within the coalition. Nauseda said, 'If Mr. \u017demaitaitis continues to embarrass himself and the country in front of our international partners and Ukraine, I don't think this coalition has a future. I believe it will change soon, as everyone will realize it's unavoidable.' Nauseda also hinted that \u017demaitaitis has pro-Russian leanings and compared him to former pro-Russian presidential candidate Eduardas Vaitkus. The Lithuanian government has consistently supported Ukraine's fight against Russia, and \u017demaitaitis' comments have been met with criticism from coalition partners and Nauseda. Saulius Skvernelis, the chairman of the Democratic Union 'For Lithuania', suggested that anyone with doubts about the decision to increase defense spending should visit Ukraine. \u017demaitaitis responded by saying he has no reason to visit Ukraine and implied that only those who want to engage in bribery, corruption, and arms trading would go there. Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, believes that \u017demaitaitis is simply filling a information vacuum, as the public lacks information about the source of defense budget funds. He emphasized that the focus should be on the government's actual decisions and actions, rather than \u017demaitaitis' comments. Skvernelis, on the other hand, disagrees and believes that \u017demaitaitis' comments are a deliberate attempt to discredit the country and represent the stance of the 'Nemunas Dawn' party. He also agrees with Nauseda's view that the coalition will not be able to continue with \u017demaitaitis and his party. Skvernelis' party is considering making changes and decisions, and will discuss the matter at their party congress in March, leaving open the possibility of withdrawing from the coalition.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 08:33 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%AB%8B%E9%99%B6%E5%AE%9B%E6%94%BF%E5%A3%87%E5%85%A7%E9%AC%A8-%E5%9F%B7%E6%94%BF%E8%81%AF%E7%9B%9F%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86%E5%85%85%E6%BB%BF%E4%B8%8D%E7%A2%BA%E5%AE%9A%E6%80%A7-081412878.html)\n\n**Socialdemocrats React Calmly to \u017demaitaitis' Statements**\nSocial democrats in Lithuania are calmly responding to President Gitanas Naus\u0117da's statement that if Rolandas \u017demaitaitis continues to discredit Lithuania with his statements, changes in the current ruling coalition will be inevitable. They acknowledge that some of the coalition partner's statements are problematic. 'It's necessary for the coalition council to meet. I counted the things R. \u017demaitaitis said, and many of them are not true, they are spreading Russian propaganda. We don't accept that. Maybe we'll hold elections soon. (\u2026) We'll try to educate our colleague,' said J. Olekas. According to the politician, \u017demaitaitis' statements are hindering smooth coalition work. 'Instead of discussing the II pension tier reform, we're now talking about some words,' said J. Olekas.\nOriginal language: lt\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 06:28 PM\nSource:[delfi.lt](https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/politics/socialdemokratai-dar-tikisi-kad-zemaitaiti-galima-isaukleti-bresta-rimtas-susitikimas-120083119)\n\n**Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117: Public politicians' arguments should not hinder the work of the state**\nSocialdemocratic leader Vilija Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 said that public politicians' arguments should not hinder the work of the state. 'Public politicians' arguments should not hinder the work of the state, I would like to emphasize this, I strongly believe that our coalition partners will support this. We have been entrusted with a great responsibility by the voters, so attention should be focused on work,' - she wrote to BNS after the social democratic board meeting. She made this statement after a public argument between Seimas Chairman Saulius Skvernelis and coalition partner 'Nemuno au\u0161ros' leader Remigijus \u017demaitaitis over a larger defense budget for the next five years. The State Defense Council (VGT) has recently confirmed the goal of allocating 5-6% of GDP for national defense between 2026-2030. The country's leaders have not yet specified the sources of funding for such initiatives, but emphasize that a significant part of it should come from European funds. 'When discussing defense funding, we agreed that a larger budget will not be at the expense of other important areas - education, healthcare, social security, and others,' - said V. Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117. 'It became clear that the patriotic conservative declarations about national defense, which ignored military advice, were not backed by political will and honest recognition of the true need for defense, were simply empty,' - she added. 'Small schools, cultural centers will not be closed' According to the social democratic leader, the board meeting also discussed priority work in the field of social policy, the preparation of the Government's action plan, defense funding issues, and other political issues. 'Social democrats are focused on work that we must do immediately, which is most relevant to the people of Lithuania. Soon - very important changes to the pension reform laws, which were also planned in our election program,' - said the politician. 'We also discussed the Government's work related to reducing the impact of prices by increasing people's income, the need for control and transparency, and the establishment of the Food Council, which is also in many European countries,' - she added. In addition, the meeting discussed education issues related to the reduction of the minimum number of students in classes. 'It was emphasized that our small schools, cultural centers will not be closed,' - she added. Currently, the education minister Raminta Popovien\u0117 told BNS that this issue is being coordinated with the Lithuanian Association of Municipalities (LSA) and municipalities. Quantitative criteria for forming the third gymnasium class, when the minimum number of students in the class can be 21, have been in effect since this autumn. Also, since last year, a rule has been in effect in the country, ensuring state funding only for gymnasium classes where there are at least 21 students. Currently, it is being discussed that when forming the eleventh class, it could have 12-15 students, and the Government's draft decision on this issue is planned to be submitted in February.\nOriginal language: lt\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 02:47 PM\nSource:[lrt.lt](https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/lietuvoje/2/2469274/i-zemaitaicio-ir-skvernelio-rietenas-isikiso-blinkeviciute-ragina-neuzgozti-darbu)\n\n**Lithuanian Coalition to Discuss Scandalous Statements about Ukraine**\nThe Lithuanian Social Democratic Party plans to discuss the scandalous statements of Remigijus \u017demaitaitis, the leader of the '\u017dvaig\u017ed\u0117s' party, about Ukraine at the coalition council meeting. According to Ras\u0105 Budbergit\u0117, a member of the Social Democratic Party, 'We will definitely discuss this issue at the coalition council meeting on Monday. Even if it's not included in the agenda, we should propose to discuss it.' She believes that \u017demaitaitis' apology or retraction of his statements is not enough. 'We need to discuss this issue from all sides.' However, Budbergit\u0117 assures that the possibility of '\u017dvaig\u017ed\u0117s' leaving the coalition is not being considered at this time, although it is 'slipping in.' The leader of the Social Democratic faction, Remigijus Motuzas, and the leader of the Democratic Union 'For Lithuania' faction, Linas Kukuraitis, also want to discuss \u017demaitaitis' statements at the coalition council meeting. \u017demaitaitis made the statements during his dispute with the Speaker of the Lithuanian Seimas, Saulius Skvernelis, who suggested that \u017demaitaitis visit Ukraine and get to know the country better. \u017demaitaitis responded by saying, 'I can visit Ukraine, but I'm not obligated to go there. Except for cases of bribery, corruption, arms sales, and state sales.'\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 04:23 PM\nSource:[eurointegration.com.ua](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2025/01/23/7203256/)\n\n**LSDP demands for explanations from Nemunas Dawn leader over Ukraine statements**\nThe Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (LSDP) is demanding explanations from the leader of the Nemunas Dawn party over statements made about Ukraine. The statements were criticized by the Office of the President and Prime Minister's adviser Justinas Argustas. The coalition agreement between LSDP, Democrats For Lithuania, and Nemunas Dawn commits to fully supporting Ukraine and striving for its victory. According to the Government's programme, restoring stable and fair peace in Europe requires Ukraine's victory in the war started by Russia, full liberation of occupied territories, restoration of territorial integrity, and sustainable security guarantees for Ukraine.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 01:49 PM\nSource:[DELFI](https://www.delfi.lt/en/en/politics/lsdp-demands-for-explanations-from-nemunas-dawn-leader-over-ukraine-statements-120081123)\n\n\n\n\n# FORECASTS\n\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 15 months, as the deadline is June 17, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is likely \"No,\" as there is currently no official coalition formed by the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania that is recognized by the government.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is if the Social Democratic Party fails to form a coalition with any other parties by the deadline, or if they form a coalition that is not officially recognized by the Lithuanian government. This could happen if ongoing tensions and disagreements within the current coalition partners persist, leading to a breakdown in negotiations or an inability to secure enough support from other parties.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if the Social Democratic Party successfully negotiates and forms a coalition with other parties, such as the Democratic Union 'For Lithuania' or the Lithuanian Union of Peasants and Greens, and this coalition is officially announced and recognized by the Lithuanian government. This could occur if the Social Democrats manage to resolve internal conflicts and present a united front, making concessions or agreements that attract other parties to join them in a coalition.\n\nRationale: Given the current political landscape and the tensions within the coalition, the status quo leans towards a \"No\" outcome. However, there is still a significant amount of time left for negotiations and changes in political dynamics, which could lead to a successful coalition formation. Good forecasters recognize that the world changes slowly, so the status quo should be given extra weight. Nonetheless, the possibility of a coalition forming cannot be entirely discounted, given the fluid nature of political alliances.\n\nFinal answer: \"Probability: 40%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 15 months, as the deadline is June 17, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania is currently leading in the polls and is part of the ruling coalition. However, there are tensions within the coalition, particularly involving the 'Nemunas Dawn' party and its leader, Remigijus \u017demaitaitis. If these tensions are not resolved, it could lead to a breakdown of the current coalition.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the Social Democratic Party failing to maintain its coalition due to internal disagreements or external pressures. For instance, if the tensions with 'Nemunas Dawn' escalate and lead to a collapse of the coalition, and the Social Democrats are unable to form a new coalition with other parties by the deadline, the outcome would be No.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve the Social Democratic Party successfully navigating the current tensions within the coalition and either maintaining the existing coalition or forming a new one with other parties. If they manage to officially announce and have the coalition recognized by the Lithuanian government by June 17, 2025, the outcome would be Yes.\n\nRationale: Given the current political landscape, the Social Democratic Party is in a strong position, leading in the polls. However, the internal tensions within the coalition present a significant challenge. The status quo suggests that the coalition is fragile, and the Social Democrats need to either resolve these tensions or form a new coalition. Considering the slow pace of political change and the time available, there is still a reasonable chance for the Social Democrats to form a recognized coalition by the deadline.\n\nProbability: 60%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 15 months, as the deadline is June 17, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be \"No,\" as the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania has not yet formed an officially recognized coalition government.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve continued internal disagreements within the current coalition or with potential coalition partners, leading to a failure to form a stable and recognized coalition government by the deadline. Additionally, if the Social Democratic Party fails to resolve conflicts with existing coalition partners, such as the issues surrounding Remigijus \u017demaitaitis and the 'Nemunas Dawn' party, this could prevent the formation of a recognized coalition.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve the Social Democratic Party successfully negotiating with other parties to form a coalition that is officially recognized by the Lithuanian government. This might involve resolving current tensions within the coalition or finding new partners to replace problematic ones, ensuring the coalition's stability and recognition.\n\nRationale: Given the current political landscape and the tensions within the coalition, the status quo leans towards a \"No\" outcome. However, there is still significant time for political negotiations and changes that could lead to a \"Yes\" outcome. The Social Democratic Party's position as the leading party in terms of votes gives them leverage to form a coalition, but they must navigate internal and external challenges to achieve this. Considering the slow nature of political changes and the current unresolved issues, the probability of a \"Yes\" outcome is moderate but not high.\n\nFinal Answer: \"Probability: 40%\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 15 months, as the deadline is June 17, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be \"No,\" as there is currently no official coalition formed by the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania that is recognized by the government.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve ongoing tensions and disagreements within the current coalition, particularly with the 'Nemunas Dawn' party, leading to a breakdown in negotiations and the inability of the Social Democratic Party to form a new coalition by the deadline. The Social Democrats' refusal to form a coalition with the second-largest party, Homeland Union-Christian Democrats, further complicates their ability to secure a majority coalition.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve the Social Democratic Party successfully negotiating with other smaller parties, such as the Democratic Union 'For Lithuania' and the Lithuanian Union of Peasants and Greens, to form a coalition that is officially recognized by the government. This would require overcoming current tensions and reaching agreements on key policy issues.\n\nRationale: Given the current political landscape, the Social Democratic Party faces significant challenges in forming a coalition. The existing tensions within the coalition, particularly with the 'Nemunas Dawn' party, and the refusal to partner with the Homeland Union-Christian Democrats, limit their options. However, there is still time for negotiations and potential shifts in alliances. Historically, political landscapes can change, but they often do so slowly. Thus, the status quo outcome of \"No\" is given extra weight.\n\nFinal Answer: Probability: 40%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 15 months, as the deadline is June 17, 2025.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be \"No,\" as the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania has not yet formed a coalition government officially recognized by the Lithuanian government.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a \"No\" outcome would involve the Social Democratic Party failing to form a coalition with any other parties due to ongoing political tensions, disagreements over policy issues, or inability to secure enough support from other parties. Additionally, the current coalition could continue to face internal conflicts and instability, preventing the Social Democrats from forming a new coalition by the deadline.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a \"Yes\" outcome would involve the Social Democratic Party successfully negotiating with other parties, possibly excluding the Homeland Union-Christian Democrats, to form a coalition that is officially recognized by the Lithuanian government. This could involve resolving current tensions within the coalition, such as the issues surrounding Remigijus \u017demaitaitis and the 'Nemunas Dawn' party, and securing agreements on key policy areas.\n\nRationale: Given the current political climate and the tensions within the coalition, the status quo leans towards a \"No\" outcome. However, there is still a significant amount of time left for negotiations and changes in political dynamics that could lead to a \"Yes\" outcome. The Social Democratic Party's position as the largest party gives them leverage, but they need to navigate the complex political landscape carefully. Good forecasters recognize that political situations can evolve, but they also acknowledge that changes often occur slowly. Therefore, while there is potential for a \"Yes\" outcome, the likelihood remains uncertain.\n\nFinal Answer: Probability: 40%\n\n",

According to a recent poll commissioned by Delfi and conducted by Spinter tyrimai, the LVZS is positioned fifth among the political parties, with 6.8% of respondents indicating it as their preferred choice. The leading party is the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (LSDP) at 12.3%, followed closely by the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) at 11%, and the Nemunas Dawn party at 8.9%. The Democratic Union 'For Lithuania' is slightly behind the LVZS with 8.7% support.\n\nAdditionally, another survey indicates that the government led by Prime Minister Ingrida Pulu\u010dkien\u0117 is struggling, with the opposition gaining momentum. The LVZS's position reflects a broader trend of declining support for the ruling coalition, as the opposition parties are increasingly favored by the electorate. The research highlights the competitive landscape of Lithuanian politics as parties prepare for the elections, with the LVZS's current polling figures suggesting challenges ahead for the party in securing a significant portion of the vote.

The move has caused concern among Lithuanian politicians. Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas called the decision a 'misunderstanding' and expressed hope that they would change their stance. The Union of Greens and Peasants of Lithuania (SZKL) condemned the decision, stating that 'sanctions against the aggressor, even if not supported by all other states, are an important way to demonstrate our country's attitude towards the aggressor state.' The party's chairman, Aurelija Vergeikaite, urged all members of the SZKL parliamentary faction to vote in favor of extending the restrictions. The speaker of the Lithuanian parliament, Saulius Skvernelis, warned of a 'fifth column' in the parliament, suggesting that some deputies may be sympathetic to Russia and skeptical about national security. Meanwhile, the leader of the Freedom Party, Tomas Vaitautas Raskauskas, handed out red carnations with black ribbons to the 18 deputies who voted against the sanctions, urging them to change their stance. However, most deputies refused the flowers, but the leader of the 'Zarya Niamunasa' party, Remigijus Zemaitytis, accepted one and thanked Raskauskas for the gesture, saying 'We will definitely change our stance, but we will strive to make sure that sanctions affect only individuals, not businesses or farms.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f](https://lv.sputniknews.ru/20250319/litovskikh-deputatov-ubezhdayut-golosovat-za-sanktsii-protiv-rf-i-belarusi-29940978.html)\n\n**Last Chance for Written Application for Postal Vote in Steiermark**\nIn the Steiermark region, voters have until Wednesday to submit a written application for a postal vote for the upcoming municipal elections on March 23. If the application is missed, voters can still collect their ballot personally until Friday. The ballot can be cast in person at the local town hall, or taken home to fill out and then returned by post. Alternatively, voters can submit their ballot at the local town hall or at any polling station on election day. The counting of postal votes will take place on Sunday after the last polling station closes. In Kapfenberg, eight parties and lists will be featured on the ballot, while in two communities in the Liezen district, only the SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP will be represented. A total of 805,173 people are eligible to vote in the Steiermark region, excluding Graz which will hold elections in 2026. In the 2020 municipal elections, the \u00d6VP gained 4.5 percentage points, while the SP\u00d6 gained 0.3 percentage points. The FP\u00d6 lost 5.66 percentage points, while the Greens gained 1.42 percentage points.

He made this statement after a closed meeting on Tuesday, where the situation in the security sphere was presented to the parliamentarians. Skvernelis emphasized that he did not necessarily mean those deputies who did not support the extension of sanctions against Russians and Belarusians for another year last week. The Seimas had previously supported the proposal to extend national sanctions against citizens of Russia and Belarus for another year, but some members of the 'Zarya Niamuno' party, part of the ruling coalition, and the Union of Peasants, Greens and Christian Families faction did not support it. The leader of the 'Zarya Niamuno' party, Remigijus \u017demaitaitis, stated that his party did not support the extension of sanctions due to the ongoing ban on the import of agricultural products. He suggested that the three Baltic states and Poland should agree on a unified package of sanctions for agricultural products, without exceptions. Lithuania first introduced national sanctions against Belarusian and Russian citizens in 2023, which were renewed and extended last year. After the events in Ukraine, Lithuania strengthened its anti-Russian rhetoric and constantly emphasizes the 'Russian threat' and the need to 'strengthen' the eastern flank of NATO. Lithuania also sees a possible 'security threat' from Belarus, which supports Russia.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 08:40 AM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430](https://lt.sputniknews.ru/20250319/v-seyme-litvy-formiruetsya-pyataya-kolonna-schitaet-spiker-parlamenta-36759283.html)\n\n**CDU/CSU and SPD struggle with declining approval ratings**\nThe Union and SPD are struggling with declining approval ratings despite their plans to form the next government.

The outcome is far from certain, and the vote could have significant implications for the future of CDU leader Friedrich Merz. The package includes a special fund for infrastructure and an exception to the debt brake for defense spending, both of which require a two-thirds majority in the parliament. While the Union, SPD, and Greens have a combined 31 seats more than the required two-thirds majority, there are already several Union members who have expressed opposition to the package. Additionally, it is unclear whether the members of the SPD and Greens who were not re-elected in the last parliamentary election will vote in favor of the package. The vote is scheduled for Tuesday at 10:00 AM, and the outcome will be crucial for Merz's future as a potential candidate for Chancellor. 'I am confident that we will achieve the necessary constitutional changes tomorrow with great unity,' said Thorsten Frei, the parliamentary business manager of the Union, on Monday.

'We are junior partners in the coalition. We would like the senior partners to clearly state their position', Skvernelis said to journalists. 'Is it acceptable for them to continue this behavior, this rhetoric? We will wait for their decision', he added. According to Skvernelis, Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas is not opposed to this development. 'The Prime Minister does not see a problem with this, the Prime Minister is one of the members of the coalition council', Skvernelis noted. Skvernelis said that representatives of his party could work in opposition, and the Lithuanian Union of Farmers and Greens, led by Aurelija Vergeikaite, could join the coalition or replace 'For Lithuania'. 'Mr. Vergeikaite will formulate clear positions in the field of security, foreign policy, and internal policy, and we will be able to discuss them. We do not consider this a barrier to reaching an agreement', Skvernelis said. However, Skvernelis previously stated that his party wanted to avoid cooperation with the 'farmers' because their leader, Ramunas Karbauskis, did not participate in the elections. Karbauskis responded that cooperation with the Democrats would only be possible if Skvernelis was not in the government, as he had previously expelled his allies from the 'farmers' in 2021. As a result, his party remained in opposition. Liberal Seimas member Eugenijus Gentvilas considers Paluckas' indifferent attitude to the scandals involving his coalition partner, Zarya Nyamunasa leader Remigijus Zemaitaitis, to be unjustified. According to Gentvilas, the Prime Minister is 'playing the dove of peace' because he is thinking about the upcoming election of the Social Democratic Party leader and does not want to lose his status as leader. 'We could say that Paluckas is a dandelion, a dove of peace, an embodiment of pacifism. But that's not true. We know Paluckas from 2017, when he was the chairman of the Social Democratic Party and openly spoke about things that didn't please him, for example, about the 'agrarians' led by Karbauskis. (...) He was not a dove of peace, a dove of peace who sits and does nothing, who values calmness', Gentvilas said. In his opinion, if Paluckas had taken a tougher stance towards his coalition partner, he would have acknowledged that he made a mistake by inviting 'Zarya Nyamunasa' to the ruling majority. However, if the Prime Minister becomes the leader of the Social Democratic Party and then takes a more resolute position towards Zemaitaitis, the assessment of his actions will be different. 'And now it's too early for him to acknowledge this mistake, so he naively, primitively portrays himself as a pacifist who likes everything. Whatever Zemaitaitis screams - everything is fine with him', Gentvilas says. However, Gentvilas emphasizes that such behavior from the Prime Minister is not justified. 'I cannot justify when the Prime Minister allows one of the coalition partners to behave in this way - regardless of what goals you pursue in a month. There should be a more serious and principled condemnation of what Zemaitaitis is doing', he thinks.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 05:31 PM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f](https://lv.sputniknews.ru/20250310/litovskaya-koalitsiya-gotovitsya-izbavitsya-ot-zari-nyamunasa-29876709.html)\n\n**Saxony State Election: CDU Leads in Preliminary Results**\nAccording to preliminary results, the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) is leading in the Saxony state election with 28.6% of the vote, followed by AfD (Alternative for Germany) with 20.4%, SPD (Social Democratic Party) with 16.3%, and Gr\u00fcnen (The Greens) with 12.3%.

from the background information, suggest that the LVZS is expected to receive around 13% of the vote, which is a decrease from their previous performance but higher than current polling suggests.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A major scandal involving key members of the LVZS or a significant shift in voter sentiment towards new or emerging parties could result in the LVZS receiving a significantly lower percentage of the vote, potentially below 5%.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden and significant policy success or a major failure by competing parties could boost the LVZS's popularity, leading to a higher percentage of the vote, potentially exceeding 15%.\n\nGiven the current information and the need to account for unknown unknowns, I will set wide confidence intervals:\n\n\"\nPercentile 10: 5.0\nPercentile 20: 6.0\nPercentile 40: 7.0\nPercentile 60: 9.0\nPercentile 80: 11.0\nPercentile 90: 13.0\n\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The exact date of the Lithuanian parliamentary elections is not specified, but given the context, it is likely to occur within the next few months.\n\n(b) The outcome if nothing changed: Based on the most recent poll, the Farmers\u2019 and Greens Union (LVZS) is currently polling at 6.8%.\n\n(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: If the current trend of declining support continues, the LVZS might receive slightly less than 6.8%, potentially around 6.0% to 6.5%.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts initially expected the LVZS to receive around 13% of the vote, but recent polls suggest a significant decline in support, indicating that expectations have been adjusted downward.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A major scandal involving key members of the LVZS could further erode public trust and lead to a significant drop in their vote share, potentially below 5%.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden shift in public opinion due to a major policy success or a failure by competing parties could lead to a resurgence in support for the LVZS, pushing their vote share back up to around 10% or higher.\n\nGiven the current information and the potential for unexpected developments, my final answer is:\n\n```\nPercentile 10: 5.0\nPercentile 20: 5.5\nPercentile 40: 6.0\nPercentile 60: 6.5\nPercentile 80: 7.0\nPercentile 90: 8.0\n```\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, but it will be resolved by the official election results published by the Lithuanian government, with a deadline of June 17, 2025.\n\n(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be 6.8%, based on the latest poll indicating the Farmers\u2019 and Greens Union (LV\u017dS) is currently polling at this level.\n\n(c) The outcome if the current trend continued could be slightly lower than 6.8%, as the party is experiencing a decline in support compared to previous elections, where they received around 18%.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets suggest that the Farmers\u2019 and Greens Union (LV\u017dS) might receive around 13% of the vote, which is a decline from their previous performance but higher than the current polling.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A major scandal or internal conflict within the Farmers\u2019 and Greens Union (LV\u017dS) emerges, leading to a significant loss of voter confidence and support, dropping their vote share to below 5%.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden shift in public opinion due to external events, such as a strong stance on a popular issue or a successful coalition-building strategy, boosts the Farmers\u2019 and Greens Union (LV\u017dS) support to above 15%.\n\nGiven the current information and acknowledging the uncertainties, my final answer is:\n\n```\nPercentile 10: 5.0\nPercentile 20: 6.0\nPercentile 40: 7.0\nPercentile 60: 9.0\nPercentile 80: 11.0\nPercentile 90: 13.0\n```\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, but it will be determined by the date of the Lithuanian parliamentary elections, which are expected to take place in 2024.\n\n(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be approximately 6.8%, based on the most recent poll results indicating the Farmers\u2019 and Greens Union (LVZS) is currently polling at this level.\n\n(c) The outcome if the current trend continued could be slightly lower than 6.8%, as the party has been experiencing a decline in support compared to previous elections, where they received around 18%.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets suggest that the Farmers\u2019 and Greens Union (LVZS) will receive around 13% of the vote, although recent polling data indicates this may be optimistic.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant political scandal involving the Farmers\u2019 and Greens Union (LVZS) could further erode public trust and lead to a substantial drop in their support, resulting in an outcome below 5%.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A major policy shift or successful coalition-building effort by the Farmers\u2019 and Greens Union (LVZS) could boost their popularity and result in an outcome above 13%.\n\nGiven the current information and accounting for uncertainties, my final answer is:\n\n```\nPercentile 10: 5.0\nPercentile 20: 5.5\nPercentile 40: 6.5\nPercentile 60: 7.5\nPercentile 80: 9.0\nPercentile 90: 11.0\n```\n\n",

A significant portion of the electorate, approximately 25.2%, remains undecided, which presents a challenge for all parties, including any new political entities. The fragmentation of the political landscape, particularly among progressive parties, has resulted in a diverse array of choices for voters, complicating their decision-making process. The ruling party, New Democracy, currently leads with 22.1% support, while the opposition party Plefsi Eleftherias follows with 13.1%. The consolidation rates for established parties, such as SYRIZA, are at historic lows, indicating a potential shift in voter allegiance.\n\nIn addition to the undecided voters, the research highlights the competitive nature of the current political environment, with established parties like the Civic Coalition and Law and Justice Party vying for dominance. Recent surveys show the Civic Coalition leading with around 34% of the vote, while the Confederation party has gained traction, indicating a possible reshaping of the political landscape. The data suggests that the upcoming elections will be influenced heavily by the undecided voters and the evolving support for both new and established parties. Overall, the research underscores the fluidity of voter sentiment in Lithuania as the elections approach.\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Who will win over the undecided voters? - What polls indicate - ProtoThema English**\nThe latest polling data shows that the 'party of the undecided' is in second place, with 25.2% of voters still undecided, according to the MRB poll. This is a significant increase from previous elections, with diverse demographic characteristics among the undecided voters. Experts believe that many undecided voters will remain uncertain for an extended period, given the two-year timeframe until the next elections. The fragmentation of the political landscape, particularly on the progressive side, has created a 'wide array of choices' for voters, making it difficult for them to make a decision. New Democracy leads in voting intention at 22.1%, followed by Plefsi Eleftherias at 13.1%. However, the 'party of the undecided' remains a strong contender, with over 25%-30% of undecided voters believed to have previously supported New Democracy. SYRIZA's consolidation rate stands at a historic low of 28.3%, while Zoe Konstantopoulou's Plefsi Eleftherias party has a consolidation rate of 79.6%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:07 PM\nSource:[protothemanews.com](https://en.protothema.gr/2025/03/19/who-will-win-over-the-undecided-voters-what-polls-indicate/)\n\n**Lithuanian Lawmakers Vote Against Extending Sanctions Against Russia and Belarus**\nA group of 18 Lithuanian lawmakers from the ruling party 'Zarya Niamunasa' and opposition parties voted against extending sanctions against Russia and Belarus. The move has caused concern among Lithuanian politicians. Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas called the decision a 'misunderstanding' and expressed hope that they would change their stance. The Union of Greens and Peasants of Lithuania (SZKL) condemned the decision, stating that 'sanctions against the aggressor, even if not supported by all other states, are an important way to demonstrate our country's attitude towards the aggressor state.' The party's chairman, Aurelija Vergeikaite, urged all members of the SZKL parliamentary faction to vote in favor of extending the restrictions. The speaker of the Lithuanian parliament, Saulius Skvernelis, warned of a 'fifth column' in the parliament, suggesting that some deputies may be sympathetic to Russia and skeptical about national security. Meanwhile, the leader of the Freedom Party, Tomas Vaitautas Raskauskas, handed out red carnations with black ribbons to the 18 deputies who voted against the sanctions, urging them to change their stance. However, most deputies refused the flowers, but the leader of the 'Zarya Niamunasa' party, Remigijus Zemaitytis, accepted one and thanked Raskauskas for the gesture, saying 'We will definitely change our stance, but we will strive to make sure that sanctions affect only individuals, not businesses or farms.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f](https://lv.sputniknews.ru/20250319/litovskikh-deputatov-ubezhdayut-golosovat-za-sanktsii-protiv-rf-i-belarusi-29940978.html)\n\n**Civic Coalition Remains Ahead in the Polls, Confederation Closes Gap with PiS**\nA recent survey conducted by Opinia24 for RMF FM radio shows that the Civic Coalition (KO) remains the leader in the polls. However, the competition for second place is becoming increasingly fierce, with the Confederation gaining ground on the Law and Justice Party (PiS). According to the survey, if parliamentary elections were held this Sunday, KO would receive the most votes with 34% of the respondents' support. PiS would come in second with 26.3% of the votes, while the Confederation would take third place with 21.4% of the votes. Other parties, such as the Third Way, New Left, and Together, would not enter the Sejm. The survey was conducted by Opinia24 using a representative sample of 1000 people from March 10-13, with a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) technique. 'The Confederation is steadily gaining ground on PiS,' said the survey. 'This trend may be related to the growing popularity of S\u0142awomir Mentzen in the presidential campaign.' \nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 06:09 PM\nSource:[wMeritum.pl](https://wmeritum.pl/sondaz-konfederacja-goni-pis-2/422367)\n\n**Coalition of Citizens leads in latest Opinia24 survey**\nAccording to the latest Opinia24 survey, the Coalition of Citizens (KO) would win the parliamentary elections with 34% of the vote, followed by Law and Justice (PiS) with 26.3% and Confederation with 21.4%.

'The elections went smoothly. According to preliminary data, around 17,000 members and supporters of the party participated. The elections are considered valid, as more than 50% of party members participated, which is necessary to ensure quorum,' said Martynas Pravalius, executive secretary of the party, in a comment to BNS. The voting for the new leader of the conservatives ended at 18:00. 'Throughout Lithuania, commissions are starting to count the votes, and the first results should be known late in the evening,' said Pravalius. According to the 'Union of Patriots - Christian Democrats of Lithuania', almost 12,000 non-party members were registered to vote in the elections. Pravalius noted that the conservatives are the only party in Lithuania that elects its chairman openly. Voting for the open election of the leader of the conservatives was held in three ways: members of the 'Union of Patriots - Christian Democrats of Lithuania' who were eligible to vote could vote at home (due to age or health), online, or in person. Five politicians were competing for the post of chairman of the 'Union of Patriots - Christian Democrats of Lithuania': Vice-Speaker of the Seimas Radviile Morkeunait-Mikulene, former ministers of national defense Laurynas Kasciunas and Arvidas Anusauskas, Seimas member Zigimantas Paviljonis, and chairman of the Jurbarkas branch Dainoras Ribakovas. The second round, if necessary, is scheduled for February 23, and online voting will take place on February 18 and 19. The chairman of the conservative party is elected for a term of four years. After the party's defeat in the parliamentary elections in October last year, the post of party leader was left by former Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, who had led the party for almost ten years.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 05:56 PM\nSource:[Lietuvos Radijas ir Televizija](https://www.lrt.lt/ru/novosti/17/2482674/v-vyborakh-lidera-partii-konservatorov-priniali-uchastie-okolo-17-tysiach-chelovek)\n\n**Five Candidates Compete for Lithuanian Conservative Party Leadership**\nIn Lithuania, the first round of voting is taking place in the election for the leader of the 'Union of Patriots - Christian Democrats of Lithuania' (SO-HDL) party.

Additionally, the presence of a large number of undecided voters could ultimately favor established parties as the election approaches.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve one of the new parties successfully capitalizing on the dissatisfaction with existing political options, effectively mobilizing undecided voters, and presenting a compelling platform that resonates with a significant portion of the electorate. This could be aided by strong leadership, effective campaigning, and favorable media coverage.\n\nRationale: Given the historical context of new parties emerging in Lithuania and the current political landscape, it's possible for a new party to gain significant support. However, the status quo outcome, where no new party gains more than 10% of the vote, remains the more likely scenario due to the inherent challenges new parties face and the lack of specific polling data indicating strong support for any new party. The presence of a large undecided voter base adds uncertainty, but it doesn't guarantee that a new party will surpass the 10% threshold.\n\nProbability: 35%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two years, as the next parliamentary elections in Lithuania are scheduled for 2024.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely be a No, as historically, while new parties frequently enter the political scene in Lithuania, not all gain significant traction to surpass the 10% threshold.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the new parties, such as the Dawn of Nemunas and the Union of Democrats for Lithuania, failing to capture the attention and support of the undecided voters, or their platforms not resonating enough with the electorate to surpass the 10% mark. Additionally, established parties could consolidate their positions, leaving little room for new entrants to gain significant vote shares.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve one of the new parties effectively capitalizing on the large percentage of undecided voters, potentially by addressing key issues that resonate with the electorate or by presenting a charismatic leadership. Additionally, any significant political or economic events that discredit existing parties could lead to a surge in support for new parties.\n\nRationale: Given the historical context of new parties frequently entering the Lithuanian political scene and the current fragmentation of the political landscape, there is a reasonable chance for a new party to gain more than 10% of the vote. However, the status quo outcome leans towards a No, as the political environment tends to change slowly, and established parties often maintain a significant portion of the vote share. The large number of undecided voters presents an opportunity, but it remains uncertain whether new parties can effectively capitalize on this.\n\nFinal Answer: Probability: 40%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two years, as the next parliamentary elections in Lithuania are scheduled for 2024.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that no new political party gains more than 10% of the vote in the upcoming parliamentary elections.

This could be due to a lack of resources, ineffective campaigning, or the electorate's preference for established parties.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve one of the new parties successfully capitalizing on a significant political or social issue that resonates with a large segment of the population. This could lead to a surge in support, particularly if the party can effectively communicate its message and mobilize undecided voters or those disillusioned with current parties.\n\nRationale: Given the historical context of new parties frequently entering the political landscape in Lithuania, there is a possibility for a new party to gain significant support. However, the status quo tends to favor established parties, and the challenges for new parties to gain more than 10% of the vote are substantial.

This could be due to a lack of effective campaigning, internal party issues, or voters preferring to stick with established parties due to familiarity or perceived stability.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve one of the new political parties successfully capitalizing on the large percentage of undecided voters and the fragmentation of the political landscape.

However, the absence of specific polling data or evidence showing strong support for these new parties at this time suggests that the status quo outcome is more likely.

A significant portion of the electorate, approximately 30%, has been identified as consistently abstaining from voting, with this tendency linked to education level, income, and profession. For instance, individuals with higher education and income levels tend to participate more actively in elections, while those in lower-income brackets and certain manual labor professions show higher rates of non-participation. The analysis suggests that addressing these disparities could be crucial in increasing voter turnout.\n\nAdditionally, recent polling data from various sources indicates fluctuating support for political parties, with a notable percentage of voters remaining undecided. This uncertainty among voters, particularly among younger demographics, could further impact overall turnout. Surveys have shown that while some parties are gaining traction, others are losing support, which may contribute to voter apathy or disengagement. The combination of these factors paints a complex picture of the electoral landscape in Lithuania as the parliamentary elections approach.\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Who will win over the undecided voters? - What polls indicate - ProtoThema English**\nThe latest polling data shows that the 'party of the undecided' is in second place, with 25.2% of voters still undecided, according to the MRB poll. This is a significant increase from previous elections, with diverse demographic characteristics among the undecided voters. Experts believe that many undecided voters will remain uncertain for an extended period, given the two-year timeframe until the next elections. The fragmentation of the political landscape, particularly on the progressive side, has created a 'wide array of choices' for voters, making it difficult for them to make a decision. New Democracy leads in voting intention at 22.1%, followed by Plefsi Eleftherias at 13.1%. However, the 'party of the undecided' remains a strong contender, with over 25%-30% of undecided voters believed to have previously supported New Democracy. SYRIZA's consolidation rate stands at a historic low of 28.3%, while Zoe Konstantopoulou's Plefsi Eleftherias party has a consolidation rate of 79.6%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 12:07 PM\nSource:[protothemanews.com](https://en.protothema.gr/2025/03/19/who-will-win-over-the-undecided-voters-what-polls-indicate/)\n\n**Coalition of Citizens leads in latest Opinia24 survey**\nAccording to the latest Opinia24 survey, the Coalition of Citizens (KO) would win the parliamentary elections with 34% of the vote, followed by Law and Justice (PiS) with 26.3% and Confederation with 21.4%.

PiS is trying to spin this as a positive result, citing the high vote share of Senator Bogdan Klich in the 2023 elections, but this is not a convincing argument. In reality, PiS has lost seven consecutive elections in Krakow, including the Sejm, Senate, City Council, regional council, presidential election, European Parliament, and now the Senate by-election. This trend is unlikely to change in the upcoming presidential election, as the KO's candidate is unknown to the Krakow voters and the campaign was short and lacking in momentum.

Specialists from the State Data Agency and the Central Electoral Commission of Lithuania analyzed three electoral campaigns: the 2023 local government elections and the 2024 presidential and parliamentary elections. They created a portrait of a citizen who consistently skips elections. The analysis showed that the tendency to vote is linked to education level, income, and profession. Analysts identified 750,000 people who did not participate in any of the considered elections, out of a total of 2.4 million eligible citizens, which is approximately 30% of the population. If the 2024 European Parliament elections were also taken into account, the data would be even worse. According to analysts, one of the key factors influencing participation in elections is education level. For example, among those with a master's degree, only around 25% did not vote, while among those with a secondary education (aged 30-44), this figure was 40%. Additionally, analysts found a link between income level and participation in elections - the higher the income, the higher the electoral activity. For instance, among those receiving the average Lithuanian salary of 1365 euros, 83% of citizens voted. In contrast, the turnout among those below the poverty line (440 euros) was 69%. The least active voters are manual laborers, loggers, fishermen, waste collectors, construction site laborers, and porters. Among them, 40-50% do not vote. On the other hand, government sector employees vote best. 'The tendency to vote is linked to education level, income, and profession,' said the analysts. 'The more educated and higher-income citizens are more likely to participate in elections.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 23, 2025 02:31 PM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430](https://lt.sputniknews.ru/20250223/v-litve-opisali-portret-khronicheski-ne-golosuyuschego-grazhdanina-36408470.html)\n\n**German Soldiers in Lithuania Receive Special Leave to Vote in German Elections**\nThe German military, Bundesver, unexpectedly granted a special leave to soldiers stationed in Lithuania, allowing them to personally vote in the German parliamentary elections on February 23.

'The anti-Russian agenda from across the ocean is the driving force behind the European Parliament's resolution, announced a week before the elections in Belarus. I think Belarus and Russia should pay less attention to what they say from across the ocean and from Brussels. We need to create our own agenda, work with it. I think this is the most correct and right step,' Jagelavicius said. He was surprised by the organization of the elections in Belarus, which is very different from those in Lithuania. Jagelavicius visited several polling stations and was surprised by the festive atmosphere, with music, dance performances, and a buffet serving tea, coffee, and snacks. 'You go to the polling station, and you hear music, there are ensembles, people are singing and dancing. There's a buffet - you can have a cup of tea, coffee, or a snack. People come to vote in families, like it's a holiday. In Lithuania, it's just a formality: you come, put the ballot in the box, and that's it,' Jagelavicius said. He believes that this organization of voting in Belarus increases voter turnout, while in Lithuania, the turnout is small due to a formal approach to elections.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 07:05 PM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/news/e54eab6e)\n\n**Belarus Election Commission Head Dismisses Lithuanian President's Comments**\nThe head of the Belarusian Central Election Commission, Igor Karpenko, dismissed the comments of Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda regarding the upcoming presidential elections in Belarus, saying that 'any statements from the Lithuanian president are meaningless.'

However, given the concerns about voting fatigue and the historical turnout data, experts might expect a turnout slightly lower than the presidential election, possibly in the mid-50s percentage range.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could be a major political scandal or a significant public health crisis that discourages voter participation.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could be a highly contentious election with significant political stakes or a major campaign to increase voter engagement, leading to higher participation.\n\nGiven these considerations, my final answer is:\n\n```\nPercentile 10: 50.0\nPercentile 20: 52.0\nPercentile 40: 55.0\nPercentile 60: 58.0\nPercentile 80: 61.0\nPercentile 90: 63.0\n```\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 7 months, as the Lithuanian parliamentary elections are expected to take place in October 2025.\n\n(b) The outcome if nothing changed would likely be similar to the previous parliamentary elections in Lithuania. Historically, voter turnout in Lithuanian parliamentary elections has ranged around 47-52%. The 2020 parliamentary elections had a turnout of approximately 47.5%.\n\n(c) The outcome if the current trend continued might reflect some voter fatigue, as this will be the third election Lithuanians participate in this year. The presidential election in May 2024 had a turnout of 59.95%, which was higher than the previous presidential election. However, the European Parliament elections typically have lower turnouts, which might influence the parliamentary elections.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets might be cautious about predicting a high turnout due to potential voter fatigue. However, the political landscape's fragmentation and the significant number of undecided voters could drive interest and participation if parties effectively mobilize their bases.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could involve a major political scandal or a significant public health crisis that discourages voter participation. Additionally, severe weather conditions on election day could also negatively impact turnout.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve a highly competitive election with significant media coverage and public interest, particularly if a new or reformed political party gains traction and energizes the electorate. Additionally, successful efforts to engage younger voters and those who typically abstain could boost turnout.\n\n\"\nPercentile 10: 45.0\nPercentile 20: 47.0\nPercentile 40: 49.0\nPercentile 60: 51.0\nPercentile 80: 54.0\nPercentile 90: 57.0\n\"\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 7 months, assuming the Lithuanian parliamentary elections are held in October 2025, as is typical for parliamentary elections in Lithuania.\n\n(b) The outcome if nothing changed would likely be similar to the voter turnout in the previous Lithuanian parliamentary elections, which was around 47.5% in 2020.\n\n(c) The outcome if the current trend continued might show a slight decrease in voter turnout due to potential voter fatigue, as this will be the third election Lithuanians vote in this year. However, the increased political engagement seen in recent elections, such as the presidential election with a turnout of 59.95%, might counterbalance this effect.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets are mixed. Some experts express concern about voter fatigue potentially lowering turnout, while others point to increased political engagement and recent higher turnouts in other elections as indicators that turnout might remain stable or even increase slightly.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could involve a major political scandal or crisis leading to widespread disillusionment with the political process, causing a significant drop in voter turnout.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve a particularly contentious or high-stakes election, with major issues at play that galvanize the electorate, leading to a surge in voter turnout.\n\nFinal answer:\n```\nPercentile 10: 45.0\nPercentile 20: 47.0\nPercentile 40: 49.0\nPercentile 60: 51.0\nPercentile 80: 54.0\nPercentile 90: 57.0\n```\n\n",
